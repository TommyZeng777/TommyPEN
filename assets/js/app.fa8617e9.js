last one unless it is switched off.\n\nthe survey of 5, 500 people explored how viewers consume television via on-demand and streaming services.\n\nthe vast majority — 80 percent — revealed they had lost sleep in order to carry on watching a series, while almost one in five admitted calling into work sick in order to continue with a box set binge.\n\ntim glanfield, editorial director of radiotimes.com, said: \"the rise of the streaming giants from the us and the traditional british broadcasters' adoption of streaming and catch-up services has fundamentally changed the way we consume tv.\" but many experts have warned that binge watching is bad for your health, linking it to depression and loneliness as it encourages neglect of work, relationships and family.",charsets:{cjk:!0},lastUpdated:"2025/05/30

As a researcher at the University of California San Diego, he believed that one day the tools would be developed to use them to save those animals.\n\n> 当KB在1972年开始收集稀有和濒临灭绝动物的皮肤样本时，他并没有对以这些样本做什么有坚定的计划。作为一个在加州圣地亚哥大学的研究者，他认为总会有一天相关的工具会被开发出来并用它们去保存这些动物。\n\nA few years later, he moved his collection to San Diego Zoo, and called it the Frozen Zoo. Today, the Frozen Zoo is the world's largest animal cryobank, with samples from over 10, 500 individual animals from 1, 220 species.\n\n> 几年之后，他讲他的收藏品移送至圣地亚哥动物园，并为其取名冷冻动物园。今天，冷冻动物园是世界上最大的动物冷冻库，有着1220个物种，超过10500个单独的动物样本。\n> \n> cryobank：冷冻库\n> \n> individual：个人、独特的、单独的\n\nSince the Frozen Zoo was founded, many milestones have been reached in the field of genetics, starting with the cloning of the first animal — a sheep named Dolly — in 1996.\n\n> 自从冷冻公园被建立以来，伴随着1996年，第一只克隆动物的诞生开始——克隆羊多丽，很多基因领域的里程碑都已经实现了。\n\nStarting in 2001, four endangered species have been cloned using genetic material from the Frozen Zoo: the Indian Gaur, a humpbacked Asian wild ox; the Banteng, a Southeast-Asian species of cattle; Przewalski's horse, once found throughout Mongolia and extinct in the wild until recently; and the Black-footed ferret, which was believed to be extinct in the wild until it resurfaced in 1981, but was then almost wiped out by an epidemic.\n\n> 在2001年，四个濒危物种使用冰冻公园中的基因材料进行了克隆：印度野牛，一种驼背的亚洲野牛；白臀野牛，是东南亚地区的一种牛；普列泽瓦尔斯基的马，曾在蒙古各地发现，最近在野外灭绝；黑脚雪貂，据信在野外已经灭绝，直到1981年重新浮出水面，但后来几乎被流行病消灭。\n> \n> species：物种\n> \n> humpbacked：驼背的\n> \n> wild ox：野牛\n> \n> Banteng：白臀野牛\n> \n> cattle：牛、家畜\n> \n> once found：可以表示 ‘曾经’ 的意思\n> \n> throughout：到处都是\n\nAlthough cloning isn't perfect, it's a useful tool to help save endangered species, because it can increase genetic diversity. When the population of a species dwindles, the remaining animals are forced to inbreed and the genetic pool shrinks, further threatening survival.

the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, leads the other members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the 20th CPC Central Committee in meeting the press at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Sunday, Oct 23, 2022.\n\n> 2022年10月23日，中国共产党中央委员会总书记习近平，带领中国共产党二十大新任的政治局常务委员在人民大会堂接受采访。\n\nThe new Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee was elected at the first plenary session of the 20th CPC Central Committee on Sunday.\n\n> 中国共产党中央委员会新任政治局常务委员会，在周日的中共第20届中央委员会第一次全体会议上被选举出来。\n> \n> Standing Committee：常务委员会（standing有站着的意思，一直站着，代表常务\n> \n> Political Bureau：政治局\n> \n> plenary：全体\n> \n> 20th CPC Central Committee：中国共产党第二十届中央委员\n\nAs the seven members of the Standing Committee strode into the spotlight at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Sunday at noon, it marked the start of the next stage of China's journey to build itself into a modern socialist country by 2035, and to become a great modern socialist country in all respects by the middle of this century.\n\n> 在周日下午，当七名常务委员迈步走进北京人民大会堂的聚光灯下时，标志着中国开始进入下一阶段的发展之路，在2035年将中国建设成一个社会主义现代化国家，并且在这个世纪的中叶全面建成社会主义现代化强国。\n> \n>

respects：所有方面\n\nWith the realization of the goal of the great rejuvenation of the nation on the horizon, the responsibility falls on the shoulders of the new leadership of the Party to inspire the Chinese people of all ethnic groups to forge ahead on the Chinese path to modernization.\n\n> 随着民族伟大复兴目标的实现即将到来，领航我国各族人民群众砥砺前行，走中国现代化道路的责任落到了党的新一届领导的肩上。\n> \n> realization：实现\n> \n> rejuvenation：复兴\n>

expressing appreciation for the trust the Party had placed in them to fulfill this responsibility during the Standing Committee's first collective meeting with the media on Sunday, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee Xi Jinping, on behalf of the new leadership of the Party, emphasized that they will always bear in mind the nature and purpose of the Party and its missions, and promised they will work diligently to fulfill their duties and not betray the great trust placed in them by the Party and the people.\n\n> 这就是为什么，常任委员在周日的第一次全体会见媒体时，对党任命他们（成为常委）履行如此责任的信任表示感谢，中国共产党中央委员会总书记习近平，作为党内的新一届领导代表，强调他们（我党）将会时刻牢记党的性质与目的以及它的任务，并且承诺他们将会努力工作去履行他们的使命，绝不背叛党和人民对他们的极大信任。\n> \n> expressing appreciation：表示感谢\n> \n> had placed in them：放入其中（可以意译为任命于此位置）\n> \n> fulfill：履行\n> \n> first collective meeting：第一次集体会议\n> \n> General Secretary：总书记\n> \n> Central Committee：中央委员会\n> \n> behalf：代表\n> \n> emphasize：强调\n> \n>

National Congress of the CPC stated that on the road ahead, the new leading group must firmly uphold and strengthen the overall leadership of the Party, adhere to the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and people-centered development, deepen reform and opening-up, and carry forward the spirit of struggle.\n\n> 这也是为什么在党的20大决议指出，在今后的道路上，新的领导集体一定要坚决拥护和加强党的全面领导，坚持走中国特色社会主义道路和以人为本的发展道路，深化改革开放，弘扬斗争精神。\n> \n> Resolution：决议\n> \n> the 20th National Congress of the CPC：中国共产党第二十次全国代表大会\n> \n> National：国家的、全国的\n> \n> Congress：国会、代表大会\n> \n> stated that：指出（state v.声明、陈述、说明）\n> \n> firmly uphold：坚决拥护\n> \n> strengthen：加强、强化\n> \n> adhere：坚持\n> \n> characteristic：特点、特质、品质\n> \n> people-centered development：以人为本的发展理念\n> \n> deepen reform and opening-up：深化改革开放\n> \n> carry forward：弘扬、发扬、推进（carry作动词，表拿、携带、搬的意思；forward为副词，意为前进、向前）\n> \n> spirit of struggle：斗争精神\n\nThese principles, crystallized in Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, have been drawn from and tested over the past 10 decades since the Party was founded. Over the past 10 years, the Party's leadership, with Xi at its core, has effectively coped with the huge risks and challenges that have resulted from the complex international situation, pushed forward socialism with Chinese characteristics and made remarkable achievements in the cause of the Party and the country.\n\n> 这些思想精神，是习近平新时代中国特色社会主义的思想结晶，是自建党100多年来的总结和检验。再过去的十年中，在以习近平为核心的党的领导下，有效的克服了由于复杂的国际局势导致的巨大风险和挑战，推进发展中国特色社会主义，并在党和国家的事业中取得了显著的成就。\n> \n> principle：道德原则，行为准则，规范、思想精神\n> \n> crystallize：结晶（例如思想结晶\n> \n> New Era：新时代 （era n.时代、纪元、时期\n> \n> draw from：从..中总结、汲取\n> \n> test：检验\n> \n> cope with：克服（困难\n> \n> have resulted from：由…导致\n> \n> cause：n. 事业、原因\n\nThat has made the Party stronger and more capable, the Chinese people more confident and united, and the connections between the two more inseparable and focused. As a result, as the Resolution of the 20th CPC National Congress noted, socialism with Chinese characteristics is demonstrating its vitality and potential in the new era, and the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation has become an irreversible historical process.\n\n> 这使得党更加强大和有能力，中国人民更加自信与团结，并且二者的连接更紧密，目标也更加明确。因此，正如20大决议所指出的那样，中国特色社会主义在新时代证明了它的生命力与潜能，中华民族的伟大复兴将会成为不可逆转的历史进程。\n> \n> capable：有能力的、能力强、足以胜任的\n> \n> focused：adj.目标明确的\n> \n> As a result：因此\n> \n> note：v.指出、注意、特别提到、记录\n> \n> demonstrating：演示\n> \n> vitality：生命力\n> \n> potential：潜力\n> \n> great rejuvenation：伟大复兴\n> \n> irreversible：不可逆转的\n\nThe numerous congratulatory messages the Party has received from around the world on the successful conclusion of its 20th CPC National Congress speak volumes of the great hopes that members of the international community, in particular those of the Global South, have pinned on it in the expectation that it will carry forward its legacy and break new ground in fulfilling its mission of serving the Chinese people and promoting the common development of humankind.\n\n> 党从世界各地收到很多祝贺二十大成功闭幕的消息，充分说明了国际社会成员，特别是全球南方的国家寄予的厚望，希望它能够发扬自己的传统，在执行为中国人民服务的任务上开辟新天地（这段奇奇怪怪）、促进人类共同发展的使命方面开辟新的天地。\n> \n> numerous：很多的\n> \n> congratulatory：祝贺的\n> \n> conclusion：结论、结束、结尾\n> \n> volumes：音量、响度\n> \n> speak volume：充分说明（这意思有点想不明白）、…发声、大谈特谈\n> \n> community：社会\n> \n> legacy：遗产、传统\n> \n> promoting：促进\n> \n> > 这段特别奇怪，我没搞明白，晚点校核下中文稿件\n\nHaving demonstrated the wisdom and resolve to effectively overcome all the difficulties and challenges the country has faced on the journey so far, confidence is high that the new leadership will not only be able to adapt the new development philosophy to the changing times and lead the country's continued advance on the road to modernization, but also make more contributions to world peace and development.\n\n> 在展示了有效克服国家迄今为止所面临的困难和挑战的智慧和决心之后，人们对新的领导层不仅能够使新的发展理念适应不断变化的时代，并带领该国在现代化道路上继续前进充满信心，也为世界和平与发展做出了更多贡献。\n> \n> demonstrated：论证\n> \n> wisdom ：智慧\n> \n> resolve：决定、决心\n> \n> overcome：克服\n> \n> has faced on the journey so far：迄今为止\n> \n> philosophy：哲学\n> \n> new development philosophy：新的发展理念\n> \n> changing times：不断变化的时代\n> \n> advance：v.前进\n\nUnder the strong leadership of the Party, there is no doubt that China will continue to work together with all peace-loving nations to safeguard world peace and promote global development through wider opening-up, and that it will continue to contribute

of China, leads the other members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the 20th CPC Central Committee in meeting the press at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Sunday, Oct 23, 2022.\n\nThe new Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee was elected at the first plenary session of the 20th CPC Central Committee on Sunday.\n\nAs the seven members of the Standing Committee strode into the spotlight at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Sunday at noon, it marked the start of the next stage of China's journey to build itself into a modern socialist country by 2035, and to become a great modern socialist country in all respects by the middle of this century.\n\nWith the realization of the goal of the great rejuvenation of the nation on the horizon, the responsibility falls on the shoulders of the new leadership of the Party to inspire the Chinese people of all ethnic groups to forge ahead on the Chinese path to modernization.\n\nThat's why, when expressing appreciation for the trust the Party had placed in them to fulfill this responsibility during the Standing Committee's first collective meeting with the media on Sunday, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee Xi Jinping, on behalf of the new leadership of the Party, emphasized that they will always bear in mind the nature and purpose of the Party and its missions, and promised they will work diligently to fulfill their duties and not betray the great trust placed in them by the Party and the people.\n\nThat's also why the Resolution of the 20th National Congress of the CPC stated that on the road ahead, the new leading group must firmly uphold and strengthen the overall leadership of the Party, adhere to the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and people-centered development, deepen reform and opening-up, and carry forward the spirit of struggle.\n\nThese principles, crystallized in Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, have been drawn from and tested over the past 10 decades since the Party was founded. Over the past 10 years, the Party's leadership, with Xi at its core, has effectively coped with the huge risks and challenges that have resulted from the complex international situation, pushed forward socialism with Chinese characteristics and made remarkable achievements in the cause of the Party and the country.\n\nThat has made the Party stronger and more capable, the Chinese people more confident and united, and the connections between the two more inseparable and focused. As a result, as the Resolution of the 20th CPC National Congress noted, socialism with Chinese characteristics is demonstrating its vitality and potential in the new era, and the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation has become an irreversible historical process.\n\nThe numerous congratulatory messages the Party has received from around the world on the successful conclusion of its 20th CPC National Congress speak volumes of the great hopes that members of the international community, in particular those of the Global South, have pinned on it in the expectation that it will carry forward its legacy and break new ground in fulfilling its mission of serving the Chinese people and promoting the common development of humankind.\n\nHaving demonstrated the wisdom and resolve to effectively overcome all the difficulties and challenges the country has faced on the journey so far, confidence is high that the new leadership will not only be able to adapt the new development philosophy to the changing times and lead the country's continued advance on the road to modernization, but also make more contributions to world peace and development.\n\nUnder the strong leadership of the Party, there is no doubt that China will continue to work together with all peace-loving nations to safeguard world peace and promote global development through wider opening-up, and that it will continue to contribute Chinese wisdom and solutions to address the pressing global challenges and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.\n\nIf you have any problems with this

据说，在英国，死亡是紧迫的，在加拿大，死亡是不可避免的，而在加州，死亡是可选择的。不足为奇。在过去的一个世纪里，美国人的预期寿命几乎翻了一番。髋骨衰竭可以更换，临床抑郁症可以得到控制，白内障只需30分钟的手术就可以摘除。这些进步为老龄化人口提供了优质的生活，这在50年前我进入医学界时是无法想象的。但是，即使是一个伟大的医疗体系也无法治愈死亡，而我们未能直面这一现实，这正威胁着我们（人类）变得伟大。\n\n①It is said that in England death is pressing, in Canada inevitable and in California optional. 据说，在英国，死亡是紧迫的，在加拿大，死亡是不可避免的，而在加州，死亡是可选择的。\n\nit is said that：据说...。\n\npressing adj. 急迫的；急迫的\n\ninevitable adj. 不可避免的；必然发生的。\n\noptional adj. 可选择的。\n\n【逻辑梳理】这句话是说，在美国，死亡是可以选择的，就是，可以选择死，也可以选择不死。在其他地方，死是必然的，甚至是急迫的。\n\n②Small wonder. 不足为奇。\n\nwonder n. 惊讶\n\n③Americans’ life expectancy has nearly doubled over the past century. 在过去的一个世纪里，美国人的预期寿命几乎翻了一番。\n\nexpect vt. 预料；预期；期待；期盼。—— expectancy n. 预料；期待\n\nlife expectancy：预期寿命\n\n④Failing hips can be replaced, clinical depression controlled, cataracts removed in a 30-minute surgical procedure. 髋骨衰竭可以更换，临床抑郁症可以得到控制，白内障只需30分钟的手术就可以摘除。\n\n这是三个句子：\n\n① Failing hips can be replaced\n\nfailing n. 缺点；弱点。\n\nhip n. 臀部；髋\n\nreplace vt. 取代\n\n② clinical depression can be controlled\n\nclinical adj. 临床的\n\ndepression n. 抑郁症\n\n③ cataracts can be removed in a 30-minute surgical procedure\n\ncataract n. 白内障\n\nremove vt. 移出\n\nsurgical adj. 外科的；外科手术的。\n\nprocedure n. 程序。\n\n⑤Such advances offer the aging population a quality of life that was unimaginable when I entered medicine 50 years ago. 这些进步为老龄化人口提供了优质的生活，这在50年前我进入医学界时是无法想象的。\n\nadvance n. 进步；发展（这里指上一句说的内容）\n\n这里的offer跟了双宾语\n\naging adj. 变老的；老年的\n\npopulation n. 人口；种群\n\nquality n. 质量；优质\n\nthat部分是定语从句，修饰life\n\nunimaginable adj. 无法想象的\n\nwhen部分是时间状语从句：when I entered medicine 50 years ago.\n\nmedicine n. 医学；药物\n\n⑥But not even a great health-care system can cure death—and our failure to confront that reality now threatens this greatness of ours. 但是，即使是一个伟大的医疗体系也无法治愈死亡，而我们未能直面这一现实，这正威胁着我们（人类）变得伟大。\n\n这是两句话，用and连接的：\n\n① But not even a great health-care system can cure death，这个not放到can的后面更好理解\n\nhealth-care system：医疗体系\n\ncure vt. 治疗；治好；治愈；解决。\n\n② our failure to confront that reality now threatens this greatness of ours.\n\nto部分是不定式后置定语，修饰failure\n\nconfront vt. 面对；遭遇\n\nthat reality指死亡\n\nthreaten vt. 威胁\n\ngreatness n. 伟大\n\n总结：第一段是说，过去一个世纪里，美国的医疗技术（水平）确实提高了很多，这个让人们过上了高质量的生活。但是，再伟大的医疗体系，也医不好死亡，就是该死的肯定要死，而不是，第一句话说的，死亡也可以选择。所以，第一句话表明美国人对自己的医疗技术的过度自信。但是，我们却不敢直接面对死亡。这会阻止人类变得伟大。\n\n第二段\n\n①Death is normal; we are genetically programmed to disintegrate and perish, even under ideal conditions. ②We all understand that at some level, yet as medical consumers we treat death as a problem to be solved. ③Shielded by third-party payers from the cost of our care, we demand everything that can possibly be done for us, even if it’s useless. ④The most obvious example is late-stage cancer care. ⑤Physicians—frustrated by their inability to cure the disease and fearing loss of hope in the patient—too often offer aggressive treatment far beyond what is scientifically justified. 死亡是正常的；从基因的角度看，我们生来就注定要解体（毁灭）和死亡，即使，在理想的条件下也是如此。在某种程度上，我们都明白这一点，但作为医疗消费者，我们把死亡视为一个有待解决的问题。因为，我们的医疗费用由第三方支付，所以，我们要求尽可能地接受所有的治疗，即使这些治疗都是无用的。最明显的例子是癌症晚期治疗。医生们对自己无法治愈这种疾病（癌症）感到沮丧，又担心病人会失去希望，所以，他们常常提供过多的治疗，这远远超出了科学合理的范围。\n\n①Death is normal; we are genetically programmed to disintegrate and perish, even under ideal conditions. 死亡是正常的；从基因的角度看，我们生来就注定要解体（毁灭）和死亡，即使，在理想的条件下也是如此。\n\n这是两句话，用分号连接\n\nnormal adj. 正常的\n\n② we are genetically programmed to disintegrate and perish, even under ideal conditions.\n\ngene n. 基因。—— genetic adj. 基因的；遗传的。—— genetically adv. 基因方面地；从基因的角度看\n\nprogramme n. 程序。 —— programmed adj. 程序化的（这里说必定的）\n\nintegrate vt. 整合；使成为一体。—— disintegrate vt. 破裂；解体；瓦解。\n\nperish vi. 死亡；毁灭\n\neven部分是让步状语\n\nideal adj. 理想的\n\n②We all understand that at some level, yet as medical consumers we treat death as a problem to be solved. 在某种程度上，我们都明白这一点，但作为医疗消费者，我们把死亡视为一个有待解决的问题。\n\n这是两句话，用yet来连接\n\nthat指上一句说的内容\n\nat some level：在某种程度上\n\nas medical consumers we treat death as a problem to be solved.\n\nmedical adj. 医疗的；医学的\n\ntreat A as B：把A看作B；认为A是B\n\nto部分是不定式后置定语，修饰problem\n\n【逻辑梳理】这里是说，人们还是不想死，不想面对死亡的现实，希望死亡这个问题可以被解决，这样大家都不用死了。\n\n③Shielded by third-party payers from the cost of our care, we demand everything that can possibly be done for us, even if it’s useless. 因为，我们的医疗费用由第三方支付，所以，我们要求尽可能地接受所有的治疗，即使这些治疗都是无用的。\n\nshield部分是分词状语，这里表示：“原因”\n\nshield n. 盾；盾牌；保护人；vt. 保护；遮挡\n\nthird-party n. 第三方\n\npayer n. 支付者；付款者\n\ncare在这里指的是“医疗保险”，就是由医保来支付\n\n主句部分：we demand everything that can possibly be done for us, even if it’s useless.\n\ndemand vt. 要求\n\nthat部分是定语从句，修饰everything\n\neven if部分是让步状语从句\n\nuseless adj. 无用的\n\n【逻辑梳理】这里是说，因为，医疗费用是由第三方出的，而且，我们害怕死亡，所以，我们会要求一切，只要能用的，都给我们用上。但是，其实很多时候，都是无用的，要死的终究要死，这是无法逃避的。在死亡面前，没有任何人有选择的权利。\n\n④The most obvious example is late-stage cancer care. 最明显的例子是癌症晚期治疗。\n\nlate-stage n. 晚起；末期\n\ncancer n. 癌症。\n\n⑤Physicians—frustrated by their inability to cure the disease and fearing loss of hope in the patient—too often offer aggressive treatment far beyond what is scientifically justified. 医生们对自己无法治愈这种疾病（癌症）感到沮丧，又担心病人会失去希望，所以，他们常常提供过多的治疗，这远远超出了科学合理的范围。\n\nphysician n. 医生；内科医生\n\nfrustrated部分是分词后置定语，修饰“医生”，frustrate vt. 挫败；沮丧\n\ninability n. 无能\n\n主句部分：Physicians too often offer aggressive treatment far beyond what is scientifically justified.\n\naggressive adj. 好斗的；进取的；好强的，这里表示过度的治疗。\n\nfar部分是形容词短语修饰treatment\n\nwhat后面是beyond的宾语从句。\n\nscientifical adj. 科学的。—— scientifically adv. 合乎科学地。\n\njustified adj. 合理的。\n\n总结：第二段是说，人们害怕死亡，而且，医疗费用也是由第三方支付的，所以，在看病的时候，往往都是要求医生，能用的治疗都用上，比如：癌症晚期的治疗，医生往往会对自己无力治愈这种疾病感到沮丧，而且，也害怕病人失去希望，所以，经常提供过多的治疗。但是，这些其实都是没有用的，只是浪费医疗资源而已，让病人感觉有希望，而不是治愈死亡。死亡是治不好的。\n\n第三段\n\n①In 1950, the U.S. spent $12.7 billion on health care. ②In 2002, the cost will be $1,540 billion. ③Anyone can see this trend is unsustainable. ④Yet few seem willing to try to reverse it. ⑤Some scholars conclude that a government with finite resources should simply stop paying for medical care that sustains life beyond a certain age—say 83 or so. ⑥Former Colorado governor Richard Lamm has been quoted as saying that the old and infirm “have a duty to die and get out of the way,” so that younger, healthier people can realize their potential. 1950年，美国在医疗保健上花费了127亿美元。到2002年，医疗保健花费将达到1.54万亿美元。任何人都可以看出这种趋势是不可持续的。然而，似乎很少有人愿意试图扭转这一局面。一些学者认为，资源有限的政府应该停止为超过一定年龄的人（比如83岁左右）支付医疗费用。美国科罗拉多州前州长理查德•拉姆曾说过，年老体弱的人“有责任死去，让出位置位来”，让更年轻、更健康的人可以实现自己的健康潜力。\n\n①In 1950, the U.S. spent $12.7 billion on health care. 1950年，美国在医疗保健上花费了127亿美元。\n\nhealth care：医疗保健\n\n【逻辑梳理】这里的费用高，就是因为过多的治疗。但是，往往是没有用的。但是，因为，人们害怕死亡，所以，还是提供过多的治疗。\n\n②In 2002, the cost will be $1,540 billion. 到2002年，医疗保健花费将达到1.54万亿美元。\n\n③Anyone can see this trend is unsustainable. 任何人都可以看出这种趋势是不可持续的。\n\nthis trend指前两句说的医疗保健花费越来越高这件事情\n\nsustain vt. 维持；保持；遭受；经受；支撑；证实。—— sustainable adj. 合理利用的；可持续的。—— unsustainable adj. 不能持续的；不能维持的。\n\n④Yet few seem willing to try to reverse it. 然而，似乎很少有人愿意试图扭转这一局面。\n\nwilling adj. 愿意的；乐意的\n\nreverse vt. 颠倒；彻底改变；废除；撤销。\n\n⑤Some scholars conclude that

As a nation, we may be overfunding the quest for unlikely cures while underfunding research on humbler therapies that could improve people’s lives. 即：日本和瑞典投入更少，但是，他们的人民活得更长、更健康。而美国则是把钱投到了那些不可能治愈的疾病上，而不是，投入到那个改善人们生活的治疗上。这表明美国的投入是不合理的。反之，日本和瑞典的投入更加合理。所以，D正确。\n\nA. more flexibly更灵活\n\nB. more extravagantly更多奢侈\n\nC. more cautiously更为谨慎\n\nD. more reasonably更合理\n\n 60.

文章意在表达这样的思想\n\n解释：\n\nA答案：无中生有。这就是长生不老的药，文章没有说到。\n\nB答案：无中生有。\n\nC答案：本文从第一句话就开说关于死亡的问题，即：在美国死亡是可以选择的，但是，其实不是，是因为美国人害怕死亡。然后，因为，美国的医疗发达，所以，美国人在医治诸如癌症这样不可治愈的疾病上，投入巨大，往往为这样的病人提供过多的治疗。这样造成了大量不合理的医疗投入。文章从第二段开始就说，死亡是一件很正常的事情，那些昂贵的治疗都是没有用的，下文也说，该死的，就死吧，不要占着位置。而且，死亡是不可治愈的，很多随着年纪增大带来的问题都是可以管理的，在这些方面日本和瑞典做得就比美国好。所以，本文试图要传达的就是死亡是不可治愈的，死亡是必然的，任何治疗都是浪费。所以，C正确。\n\nD答案：是文章的内容，但是，不是本文的目的，本文的目的就是要借助不断的需求造成的投入的增加来说明死亡是不可避免的，因为，这些医疗投入都是浪费掉的，没有必要的。就是拿再多的钱去医治一个癌症晚期的人，都是医不好的，只是浪费资源。\n\nA.

死亡是正常的；从基因的角度看，我们生来就注定要解体（毁灭）和死亡，即使，在理想的条件下也是如此。在某种程度上，我们都明白这一点，但作为医疗消费者，我们把死亡视为一个有待解决的问题。因为，我们的医疗费用由第三方支付，所以，我们要求尽可能地接受所有的治疗，即使这些治疗都是无用的。最明显的例子是癌症晚期治疗。医生们对自己无法治愈这种疾病（癌症）感到沮丧，又担心病人会失去希望，所以，他们常常提供过多的治疗，这远远超出了科学合理的范围。\n\n①death

implied in the first sentence?\n\n 57. 文章第一句话暗示的是什么?\n\n解释：\n\na答案：说反了，他们无法面对死亡。\n\nb答案：不是这句话的意思。\n\nc答案：总结：第一段是说，过去一个世纪里，美国的医疗技术（水平）确实提高了很多，这个让人们过上了高质量的生活。但是，再伟大的医疗体系，也医不好死亡，就是该死的肯定要死，而不是，第一句话说的，死亡也可以选择。所以，第一句话表明美国人对自己的医疗技术的过度自信。但是，我们却不敢直接面对死亡。这会阻止人类变得伟大。所以，c正确。\n\nd答案：文章没有说他们感到骄傲，而且，也不是第一句话的意思。\n\na. americans are better prepared for death than other people美国人比其他人对死亡更有准备\n\nb. americans enjoy a higher life quality than ever before美国人的生活质量比以往任何时候都高\n\nc. americans are over-confident of their

作者用癌症病人的例子，是为了表明\n\n解释：\n\na答案：总结：第二段是说，人们害怕死亡，而且，医疗费用也是由第三方支付的，所以，在看病的时候，往往都是要求医生，能用的治疗都用上，比如：癌症晚期的治疗，医生往往会对自己无力治愈这种疾病感到沮丧，而且，也害怕病人失去希望，所以，经常提供过多的治疗。但是，这些其实都是没有用的，只是浪费医疗资源而已，让病人感觉有希望，而不是治愈死亡。死亡是治不好的。而且，文章下文也说医疗花费猛增。所以，a正确。\n\nb答案：是文章的内容，但是，不是作者用这个例子的目的。\n\nc答案：文章没有提到some治疗方法的内容。\n\nd答案：无中生有。文章只说越来越多，没有说承担不起。\n\na. medical resources are often wasted医疗资源经常被浪费\n\nb. doctors are helpless against fatal diseases医生对致命的疾病无能为力\n\nc. some treatments are too aggressive有些治疗方法过于激进\n\nd. medical costs are becoming

lamm（理查德•拉姆）这个人说的话的态度，是什么呢？他是支持这个人的观点的，只是他认为，rl的说法太过分了。所以，这叫保留意见的赞同，我支持这个观点，但是，我还有话要补充。或者不会说得那么过分。所以，b正确。\n\nc答案：无中生有。看不出来，作者并没有批评。\n\nd答案：无中生有。作者是有保留的。\n\na. strong disapproval强烈的反对\n\nb. reserved consent保留的同意\n\nc. slight contempt轻微的蔑视\n\nd. enthusiastic support热情支持\n\n 59. in contrast to the u.s., japan and sweden are funding their medical care\n\n 60. 与美国相比，日本和瑞典医疗投资\n\n解释：\n\na答案：无中生有。\n\nb答案：无中生有。日本和瑞典投入少。\n\nc答案：无中生有。\n\nd答案：i also know that people in japan and sweden, countries that spend far less on medical care, have achieved longer, healthier lives than we have. as a nation, we may be overfunding the quest for unlikely cures while underfunding research on humbler therapies that could improve people’s lives. 即：日本和瑞典投入更少，但是，他们的人民活得更长、更健康。而美国则是把钱投到了那些不可能治愈的疾病上，而不是，投入到那个改善人们生活的治疗上。这表明美国的投入是不合理的。反之，日本和瑞典的投入更加合理。所以，d正确。\n\na. more flexibly更灵活\n\nb. more extravagantly更多奢侈\n\nc. more cautiously更为谨慎\n\nd. more reasonably更合理\n\n 60. the text intends to express the idea that\n\n 61. 文章意在表达这样的思想\n\n解释：\n\na答案：无中生有。这就是长生不老的药，文章没有说到。\n\nb答案：无中生有。\n\nc答案：本文从第一句话就开说关于死亡的问题，即：在美国死亡是可以选择的，但是，其实不是，是因为美国人害怕死亡。然后，因为，美国的医疗发达，所以，美国人在医治诸如癌症这样不可治愈的疾病上，投入巨大，往往为这样的病人提供过多的治疗。这样造成了大量不合理的医疗投入。文章从第二段开始就说，死亡是一件很正常的事情，那些昂贵的治疗都是没有用的，下文也说，该死的，就死吧，不要占着位置。而且，死亡是不可治愈的，很多随着年纪增大带来的问题都是可以管理的，在这些方面日本和瑞典做得就比美国好。所以，本文试图要传达的就是死亡是不可治愈的，死亡是必然的，任何治疗都是浪费。所以，c正确。\n\nd答案：是文章的内容，但是，不是本文的目的，本文的目的就是要借助不断的需求造成的投入的增加来说明死亡是不可避免的，因为，这些医疗投入都是浪费掉的，没有必要的。就是拿再多的钱去医治一个癌症晚期的人，都是医不好的，只是浪费资源。\n\na. medicine will further prolong people’s lives药物将进一步延长人们的生命\n\nb. life beyond a certain limit is not worth living超过一定限度的生命不值得活下去\n\nc. death should be accepted as a fact of life人们应该接受死亡是生命的一个事实（死亡是生命的必然）\n\nd. excessive demands increase the cost of health care过度的需求增加",charsets:{cjk:!0},lastUpdated:"2025/05/30

It can be said that it is a major weakness of domestic film industry.\n\n中文翻译\n\n然而，流浪地球系列的出现，表明国产电影行业中是有一群人在默默努力拍出好的电影的。\n\n\nHowever, the appearance of Wandering Earth series shows that there are a group of people in the domestic film industry who are quietly trying to make good films.\n\n中文翻译\n\n然而，流浪地球系列的出现，表明国产电影行业中是有一群人在默默努力拍出好的电影的。\n\n\nRecalling that in 2019, Wandering Earth 1 was born, the audience was all shocked by the magnificent sci-fi scenes and unique plot. It is generally believed that Wandering Earth opened a door for domestic science fiction films. However, the good scene is not long. Another domestic sci-fi film in the same year, Shanghai Fortress, immediately brought the film level back to the bottom, and was dubbed by many people as "closing the door again". In addition, in the three years under the influence of the epidemic, many people may not have expected that there will be a second film in this series, and it can also achieve a new breakthrough, which is quite rare in the series of films.\n\n中文翻译\n\n回想起2019年，流浪地球1横空出世，观众们无不被其中波澜壮阔的科幻场面和独特的剧情所震撼到，大家普遍认为，流浪地球为国产的科幻片打开了一扇大门。 不过好景并不长，同年的另一部国产科幻电影上海堡垒，一下子就又把电影水平拉回了谷底，被很多人戏称为"把这扇门又关上了"。加之疫情影响下的三年，可能很多人没料到会有这个系列第二部，而且还能实现全新的突破，在第一部的基础上实现全面的超越，这是在系列电影中相当少见的。\n\n\nThree-line narration is used in the plot, which is rare in traditional films. The narrative style is completely rid of Hollywood\'s personal heroism. Everyone is not the protagonist, but also the protagonist. It shows the wisdom and values of Chinese civilization to audiences around the world, which is quite rare in films. Maybe foreign audiences will feel that there are too many political implications and ideologies, which is mainly caused by the long-term demonization of socialist culture by western country. But when we think rationally about the plot, I believe that the foreign people can experience the charm of Chinese culture and wisdom.

there\n\nA The market for tourism in remote areas is booming as never before. Countries all across the world are actively promoting their ‘wilderness’ regions - such as mountains, Arctic lands, deserts, small islands and wetlands - to high-spending tourists. The attraction of these areas is obvious: by definition, wilderness tourism requires little or no initial investment. But that does not mean that there is no cost. As the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development recognized, these regions are fragile (i.e. highly vulnerable to abnormal pressures) not just in terms of their ecology, but also in terms of the culture of their inhabitants. The three most significant types of fragile environment in these respects, and also in terms of the proportion of the Earth’s surface they cover, are deserts, mountains and Arctic areas. An important characteristic is their marked seasonality, with harsh conditions prevailing for many months each year. Consequently, most human activities, including tourism, are limited to quite clearly defined parts of the year.\n\nTourists are drawn to these regions by their natural landscape beauty and the unique cultures of their indigenous people. And poor governments in these isolated areas have welcomed the new breed of ‘adventure tourist’, grateful for the hard currency they bring. For several years now, tourism has been the prime source of foreign exchange in Nepal and Bhutan. Tourism is also a key element in the economies of Arctic zones such as Lapland and Alaska and in desert areas such as Ayers Rock in Australia and Arizona’s Monument Valley.\n\nSome of the disruptive effects of wilderness tourism\n\nB Once a location is established as a main tourist destination, the effects on the local community are profound. When hill-farmers, for example, can make more money in a few weeks working as porters for foreign trekkers than they can in a year working in their fields, it is not surprising that many of them give up their farm-work, which is thus left to other members of the family. In some hill-regions, this has led to a serious decline in farm output and a change in the local diet, because there is insufficient labour to maintain terraces and irrigation systems and tend to crops. The result has been that many people in these regions have turned to outside supplies of rice and other foods.\n\nIn Arctic and desert societies, year-round survival has traditionally depended on hunting animals and fish and collecting fruit over a relatively short season. However, as some inhabitants become involved in tourism, they no longer have time to collect wild food; this has led to increasing dependence on bought food and stores. Tourism is not always the culprit behind such changes. All kinds of wage labour, or government handouts, tend to undermine traditional survival systems. Whatever the cause, the dilemma is always the same: what happens if these new, external sources of income dry up?\n\nThe physical impact of visitors is another serious problem associated with the growth in adventure tourism. Much attention has focused on erosion along major trails, but perhaps more important are the deforestation and impacts on water supplies arising from the need to provide tourists with cooked food and hot showers. In both mountains and deserts, slow-growing trees are often the main sources of fuel and water supplies may be limited or vulnerable to degradation through heavy use.\n\nHow local communities can balance their own needs with the demands of wilderness tourism C Stories about the problems of tourism have become legion in the last few years. Yet it does not have to be a problem. Although tourism inevitably affects the region in which it takes place, the costs to these fragile environments and their local cultures can be minimized. Indeed, it can even be a vehicle for reinvigorating local cultures, as has happened with the Sherpas of Nepal’s Khumbu Valley and in some Alpine villages. And a growing number of adventure tourism operators are trying to ensure that their activities benefit the local population and environment over the long term.\n\nIn the Swiss Alps, communities have decided that their future depends on integrating tourism more effectively with the local economy. Local concern about the rising number of second home developments in the Swiss Pays d’Enhaut resulted in limits being imposed on their growth. There has also been a renaissance in communal cheese production in the area, providing the locals with a reliable source of income that does not depend on outside visitors.\n\nMany of the Arctic tourist destinations have been exploited by outside companies, who employ transient workers and repatriate most of the profits to their home base. But some Arctic communities are now operating tour businesses themselves, thereby ensuring that the benefits accrue locally. For instance, a native corporation in Alaska, employing local people, is running an air tour from Anchorage to Kotzebue, where tourists eat Arctic food, walk on the tundra and watch local musicians and dancers.\n\nNative people in the desert regions of the American Southwest have followed similar strategies, encouraging tourists to visit their pueblos and reservations to purchase high-quality handicrafts and artwork. The Acoma and San Ildefonso pueblos have established highly profitable pottery businesses, while the Navajo and Hopi groups have been similarly successful with jewellery.\n\nToo many people living in fragile environments have lost control over their economies, their culture and their environment when tourism has penetrated their homelands. Merely restricting tourism cannot be the solution to the imbalance, because people’s desire to see new places will not just disappear. Instead, communities in fragile environments must achieve greater control over tourism ventures in their regions, in order to balance their needs and aspirations with the demands of tourism. A growing number of communities are demonstrating that, with firm communal decision-making, this is possible. The critical question now is whether this can become the norm, rather than the exception.",normalizedContent:"# t4p1 the impact of wilderness tourism\n\nfragile regions and the reasons for the

lonely\" 的情况可能是因为发音相似或者语速较快导致的听觉误解。要区分这两种说法，可以注意以下几点：\n     > \n     >  1. 重点词的强调: \"we'll only be here\" 中的重点词是 \"only\"，表示只会在这里待一小段时间。如果是 \"we lonely be here\"，这个句子的意思就变得不合逻辑了，因为 \"lonely\" 表示孤独而不是时间短暂。\n     >  2. 语境: 确定整个句子的语境有助于理解。如果谈话内容是关于待在某处的时间，那么更有可能是 \"we'll only be here\"。\n     >  3. 听力训练: 练习听力可以帮助提高对于口语连读的理解和区分能力。可以通过听音频、对话或者参加语言课程来提升这方面的技能。\n     > \n     >

The year 2006 marks the point at which expenditure on mobile services overtook that for residential phone services.\n\n很明显，在这10年间，固定电话的支出稳步下降，而移动电话的支出迅速增加。2006年是移动服务支出超过住宅电话服务支出的时间点。\n\nIn 2001, US consumers spent an average of nearly $700 on residential phone services, compared to only around $200 on cell phone services. Over the following five years, average yearly spending on landlines dropped by nearly $200. By contrast, expenditure on mobiles rose by approximately $300.\n\n2001年，美国消费者在住宅电话服务上的平均支出接近700美元，而在手机服务上的支出仅约200美元。在接下来的五年里，固定电话的平均年度支出减少了近200美元。相比之下，移动电话的支出增加了约300美元。\n\nIn the year 2006, the average American paid out the same amount of money on both types of phone service, spending just over $500 on each. By 2010, expenditure on mobile phones had reached around $750, while the figure for spending on residential services had fallen to just over half this amount.\n\n2006年，美国人在这两种电话服务上的支出金额相同，每种支出刚超过500美元。到2010年，手机支出达到约750美元，而住宅服务的支出则降至此数额的一半多一点。\n\n\n# Simon S102\n\nThe diagram illustrates the various stages in the life of a honey bee. We can see that the complete life cycle lasts between 34 and 36 days. It is also noticeable that there are five main stages in the development of the honey bee, from egg to mature adult insect.\n\n图表展示了蜜蜂生命周期的各个阶段。可以看出，蜜蜂的完整生命周期持续34至36天。同样值得注意的是，蜜蜂的发展从卵到成熟成虫共有五个主要阶段。\n\nThe life cycle of the honey bee begins when the female adult lays an egg; the female typically lays one or two eggs every 3 days. Between 9 and 10 days later, each egg hatches and the immature insect, or nymph, appears.\n\n蜜蜂的生命周期开始于成年雌蜂产卵；雌蜂通常每3天产一到两个卵。在9到10天后，每个卵孵化，出现幼虫（若虫）。\n\nDuring the third stage of the life cycle, the nymph grows in size and sheds its skin three times. This moulting first takes place 5 days after the egg hatches, then 7 days later, and again another 9 days later. After a total of 30 to 31 days from the start of the cycle, the young adult honey bee emerges from its final moulting stage, and in the space of only 4 days it reaches full maturity.\n\n在生命周期的第三阶段，若虫体积增大并蜕皮三次。第一次蜕皮发生在卵孵化后5天，然后是7天后，再次是再过9天。从周期开始后总共30到31天，年轻的成年蜜蜂从最后一次蜕皮阶段出现，在短短4天内达到完全成熟。\n\n\n# Simon S103\n\nThe chart compares average figures for temperature and precipitation over the course of a calendar year in Kolkata. It is noticeable that monthly figures for precipitation in Kolkata vary considerably, whereas monthly temperatures remain relatively stable. Rainfall is highest from July to August, while temperatures are highest in April and May.\n\n该图表比较了加尔各答一年中的平均温度和降水量。值得注意的是，加尔各答的月降水量变化较大，而月温度相对稳定。降雨量在7月到8月最高，而温度在4月和5月最高。\n\nBetween the months of January and May, average temperatures in Kolkata rise from their lowest point at around 20°C to a peak of just over 30°C. Average rainfall in the city also rises over the same period, from approximately 20mm of rain in January to 100mm in May.\n\n在1月至5月期间，加尔各答的平均温度从最低点约20°C上升到刚刚超过30°C的高点。同期，城市的平均降雨量也从1月的约20毫米上升到5月的100毫米。\n\nWhile temperatures stay roughly the same for the next four months, the amount of rainfall more than doubles between May and June. Figures for precipitation remain above 250mm from June to September, peaking at around 330mm in July. The final three months of the year see a dramatic fall in precipitation, to a low of about 10mm in December, and a steady drop in temperatures back to the January average.\n\n尽管接下来四个月的温度大致相同，但5月到6月间的降雨量增加了一倍以上。6月至9月的降水量保持在250毫米以上，7月达到约330毫米的高峰。年底最后三个月降水量急剧下降，到12月降至约10毫米，并且温度稳步回落至1月的平均水平。\n\n\n# Simon S104\n\nThe bar charts compare students of different ages in terms of why they are studying and whether they are supported by an employer.\n\n条形图比较了不同年龄的学生在为什么学习以及是否得到雇主支持方面的差异。\n\nIt is clear that the proportion of students who study for career purposes is far higher among the younger age groups, while the oldest students are more likely to study for interest. Employer support is more commonly given to younger students.\n\n显然，为职业目的学习的学生比例在年轻年龄组中远高于其他组，而最年长的学生更可能因兴趣而学习。雇主的支持更多地给予年轻学生。\n\nAround 80% of students aged under 26 study to further their careers, whereas only 10% study purely out of interest. The gap between these two proportions narrows as students get older, and the figures for those in their forties are the same, at about 40%. Students aged over 49 overwhelmingly study for interest (70%) rather than for professional reasons (less than 20%).\n\n大约80%的26岁以下学生为了进一步发展其职业而学习，而只有10%的学生纯粹出于兴趣而学习。这两个比例之间的差距随着学生年龄的增长而缩小，四十多岁的学生比例相同，约为40%。49岁以上的学生绝大多数是因兴趣（70%）而非职业原因（少于20%）而学习。\n\nJust over 60% of students aged under 26 are supported by their employers. By contrast, the 30-39 age group is the most self-sufficient, with only 30% being given time off and help with fees. The figures rise slightly for students in their forties and for those aged 50 or more.\n\n超过60%的26岁以下学生得到了雇主的支持。相比之下，30-39岁的年龄组最为自给自足，只有30%的人获得了休假和费用帮助。四十多岁的学生和50岁以上的学生的数字略有上升。\n\n\n# Simon S105\n\nThe bar chart compares the number of incidents and injuries for every 100 million passenger miles traveled on five different types of public transport in 2002.\n\n条形图比较了2002年五种不同公共交通方式每一亿乘客英里旅行中发生的事故和伤害数量。\n\nIt is clear that the most incidents and injuries took place on demand-response vehicles. By contrast, commuter rail services recorded by far the lowest figures.\n\n很明显，需求响应型车辆发生了最多的事故和伤害。相比之下，通勤铁路服务的数字远远最低。\n\nA total of 225 incidents and 173 injuries, per 100 million passenger miles traveled, took place on demand-response transport services. These figures were nearly three times as high as those for the second highest category, bus services. There were 76 incidents and 66 people were injured on buses.\n\n在需求响应型交通服务上，每一亿乘客英里旅行中共发生了225起事故和173起伤害。这些数字几乎是第二高类别，即公交服务数字的三倍。公交车上发生了76起事故，66人受伤。\n\nRail services experienced fewer problems. The number of incidents on light rail trains equaled the figure recorded for buses, but there were significantly fewer injuries, at only 39. Heavy rail services saw lower numbers of such events than light rail services, but commuter rail passengers were even less likely to experience problems. In fact, only 20 incidents and 17 injuries occurred on commuter trains.\n\n铁路服务遇到的问题较少。轻轨列车的事故数量与公交车记录的数字相等，但受伤人数显著较少，仅为39人。重轨服务的此类事件数量低于轻轨服务，但通勤铁路乘客遇到问题的可能性更小。实际上，通勤列车仅发生了20起事故和17起伤害。\n\n\n# Simon S106\n\nThe line graph compares the percentage of people aged 65 or more in three countries over a period of 100 years. It is clear that the proportion of elderly people increases in each country between 1940 and 2040. Japan is expected to see the most dramatic changes in its elderly population.\n\n折线图比较了三个国家中65岁及以上人口的百分比，时间跨度为100年。很明显，在1940年到2040年间，每个国家的老年人口比例都在增加。预计日本在老年人口中将看到最剧烈的变化。\n\nIn 1940, around 9% of Americans were aged 65 or over, compared to about 7% of Swedish people and 5% of Japanese people. The proportions of elderly people in the USA and Sweden rose gradually over the next 50 years, reaching just under 15% in 1990. By contrast, the figures for Japan remained below 5% until the early 2000s.\n\n1940年，大约9%的美国人年龄在65岁以上，相比之下，约7%的瑞典人和5%的日本人。在接下来的50年里，美国和瑞典的老年人口比例逐渐上升，到1990年接近15%。相比之下，日本的数据直到21世纪初仍然低于5%。\n\nLooking into the future, a sudden increase in the percentage of elderly people is predicted for Japan, with a jump of over 15% in just 10 years from 2030 to 2040. By 2040, it is thought that around 27% of the Japanese population will be 65 years old or more, while the figures for Sweden and the USA will be slightly lower, at about 25% and 23% respectively.\n\n展望未来，预计日本的老年人口比例将突然增加，在2030年到2040年的10年间增加超过15%。预计到2040年，约27%的日本人将年满65岁或以上，而瑞典和美国的数据将略低，分别约为25%和23%。\n\n\n# Simon S107\n\nThe table shows percentages of consumer expenditure for three categories of products and services in five countries in 2002.\n\n该表显示了2002年五个国家在三类产品和服务上的消费支出百分比。\n\nIt is clear that the largest proportion of consumer spending in each country went on food, drinks, and tobacco. On the other hand, the leisure/education category has the lowest percentages in the table. Out of the five countries, consumer spending on food, drinks, and tobacco was noticeably higher in Turkey, at 32.14%, and Ireland, at nearly 29%. The proportion of spending on leisure and education was also highest in Turkey, at 4.35%, while expenditure on clothing and footwear was significantly higher in Italy, at 9%, than in any of the other countries.\n\n很明显，每个国家的消费支出中食品、饮料和烟草的比例最大。另一方面，休闲/教育类别在表中的百分比最低。在这五个国家中，土耳其和爱尔兰在食品、饮料和烟草上的消费支出明显较高，分别为32.14%和近29%。在休闲和教育方面的支出比例，土耳其也是最高的，为4.35%，而意大利在服装和鞋类的支出上明显高于其他国家，为9%。\n\nIt can be seen that Sweden had the lowest percentages of national consumer expenditure for food/drinks/tobacco and for clothing/footwear, at nearly 16% and just over 5% respectively. Spain had slightly higher figures for these categories, but the lowest figure for leisure/education, at only 1.98%.\n\n可以看出，瑞典在食品/饮料/烟草和服装/鞋类的国民消费支出百分比最低，分别为近16%和略高于5%。西班牙在这些类别的数字略高，但在休闲/教育方面的数字最低，仅为1.98%。\n\n\n# Simon S108\n\nThe charts compare the amount of water used for agriculture, industry and homes around the world, and water use in Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nIt is clear that global water needs rose significantly between 1900 and 2000, and that agriculture accounted for the largest proportion of water used. We can also see that water consumption was considerably higher in Brazil than in the Congo.\n\nIn 1900, around 500km³ of water was used by the agriculture sector worldwide. The figures for industrial and domestic water consumption stood at around one fifth of that amount. By 2000, global water use for agriculture had increased to around 3000km³, industrial water use had risen to just under half that amount, and domestic consumption had reached approximately 500km³.\n\nIn the year 2000, the populations of Brazil and the Congo were 176 million and 5.2 million respectively. Water consumption per person in Brazil, at 359m³, was much higher than that in the Congo, at only 8m³, and this could be explained by the fact that Brazil had 265 times more irrigated land.\n\n\n# Simon S109\n\nThe bar chart compares the cost of an average house in five major cities over aperiod of 13 years from 1989. We can see that house prices fell overall between 1990 and 1995, but most of the cities saw rising prices between 1996 and 2002. London experienced by far the greatest changes in house prices over the 13-year period.\n\nOver the 5 years after 1989, the cost of average homes in Tokyo and London dropped by around 7%, while New York house prices went down by 5%. By contrast, prices rose by approximately 2% in both Madrid and Frankfurt.\n\nBetween 1996 and 2002, London house prices jumped to around 12% above the 1989 average. Homebuyers in New York also had to pay significantly more, with prices rising to 5% above the 1989 average, but homes in Tokyo remained cheaper than they were in 1989. The cost of an average home in Madrid rose by a further 2%, while prices in Frankfurt remained stable.\n\n\n# Simon S110\n\nIt is noticeable that levels of poverty were higher for single people than for couples, and people with children were more likely to be poor than those without. Poverty rates were considerably lower among elderly people.\n\nOverall, 11% of Australians, or 1,837,000 people, were living in poverty in 1999. Aged people were the least likely to be poor, with poverty levels of 6% and 4% for single aged people and aged couples respectively.\n\nJust over one fifth of single parents were living in poverty, whereas only 12% of parents living with a partner were classed as poor. The same pattern can be seen for people with no children: while 19% of single people in this group were living below the poverty line, the figure for couples was much lower, at only 7%.\n\n\n# Simon S111\n\nThe main difference between the two sites is that S1 is outside the town, whereas S2 is in the town centre. The sites can also be compared in terms of access by road or rail, and their positions relative to three smaller towns.\n\nLooking at the information in more detail, S1 is in the countryside to the northwest of Garlsdon, but it is close to the residential area of the town. S2 is also close to the housing area, which surrounds the town centre.\n\nThere are main roads from Hindon, Bransdon and Cransdon to Garlsdon town centre, but this is a no traffic zone, so there would be no access to S2 by car. By contrast, S1 lies on the main road to Hindon, but it would be more difficult to reach from Bransdon and Cransdon. Both supermarket sites are close to the railway that runs through Garlsdon from Hindon to Cransdon.\n\n\n# Simon S112\n\nThe bar chart compares consumer spending on six different items in Germany, Italy, France and Britain.\n\nIt is clear that British people spent significantly more money than people in the other three countries on all six goods. Of the six items, consumers spent the most money on photographic film.\n\nPeople in Britain spent just over £170,000 on photographic film, which is the highest figure shown on the chart. By contrast, Germans were the lowest overall spenders, with roughly the same figures (just under £150,000) for each of the six products.\n\nThe figures for spending on toys were the same in both France and Italy, at nearly £160,000. However, while French people spent more than Italians on photographic film and CDs, Italians paid out more for personal stereos, tennis racquets and perfumes. The amount spent by French people on tennis racquets, around £145,000, is the lowest figure shown on the chart.\n\n\n# Simon S113\n\nThe diagrams show how house designs differ according to climate. The most noticeable difference between houses designed for cool and warm climates is in the shape of the roof. The designs also differ with regard to the windows and the use of insulation.\n\nWe can see that the cool climate house has a high-angled roof, which allows sunlight to enter through the window. By contrast, the roof of the warm climate house has a peak in the middle and roof overhangs to shade the windows. Insulation and thermal building materials are used in cool climates to reduce heat loss, whereas insulation and reflective materials are used to keep the heat out in warm climates.\n\nFinally, the cool climate house has one window which faces the direction of the sun, while the warm climate house has windows on two sides which are shaded from the sun. By opening the two windows at night, the house designed for warm climates can be ventilated.\n\n\n# Simon S114\n\nThe picture illustrates the way in which water passes from ocean to air to land during the natural process known as the water cycle.\n\nThree main stages are shown on the diagram. Ocean water evaporates, falls as rain, and eventually runs back into the oceans again.\n\nBeginning at the evaporation stage, we can see that 80% of water vapour in the air comes from the oceans. Heat from the sun causes water to evaporate, and water vapour condenses to form clouds. At the second stage, labelled ‘precipitation’ on the diagram, water falls as rain or snow.\n\nAt the third stage in the cycle, rainwater may take various paths. Some of it may fall into lakes or return to the oceans via ‘surface runoff’. Otherwise, rainwater may filter through the ground, reaching the impervious layer of the earth. Salt water intrusion is shown to take place just before groundwater passes into the oceans to complete the cycle.\n\n\n# Simon S115\n\nThe first picture shows the layout of an art gallery, and the second shows some proposed changes to the gallery space.\n\nIt is clear that significant changes will be made in terms of the use of floor space in the gallery. There will be a completely new entrance and more space for exhibitions.\n\nAt present, visitors enter the gallery through doors which lead into a lobby. However, the plan is to move the entrance to the Parkinson Court side of the building, and visitors will walk straight into the exhibition area. In place of the lobby and office areas, which are shown on the existing plan, the new gallery plan shows an education area and a small storage area.\n\nThe permanent exhibition space in the redeveloped gallery will be about twice as large as it is now because it will occupy the area that is now used for temporary exhibitions. There will also be a new room for special exhibitions. This room is shown in red on the existing plan and is not currently part of the gallery.\n\n\n# Simon S116\n\nThe table compares the six networks in terms of their age, size and the number of people who use them each year. It is clear that the three oldest underground systems are larger and serve significantly more passengers than the newer systems.\n\nThe London underground is the oldest system, having opened in 1863. It is also the largest system, with 394 kilometres of route. The second largest system, in Paris, is only about half the size of the London underground, with 199 kilometres of route. However, it serves more people per year. While only third in terms of size, the Tokyo system is easily the most used, with 1927 million passengers per year.\n\nOf the three newer networks, the Washington DC underground is the most extensive, with 126 kilometres of route, compared to only 11 kilometres and 28 kilometres for the Kyoto and Los Angeles systems. The Los Angeles network is the newest, having opened in 2001, while the Kyoto network is the smallest and serves only 45 million passengers per year.\n\n\n# Simon S117\n\nThe pie charts compare the amount of electricity produced using five different sources of fuel in two countries over two separate years.\n\nTotal electricity production increased dramatically from 1980 to 2000 in both Australia and France. While the totals for both countries were similar, there were big differences in the fuel sources used.\n\nCoal was used to produce 50 of the total 100 units of electricity in Australia in 1980, rising to 130 out of 170 units in 2000. By contrast, nuclear power became the most important fuel source in France in 2000, producing almost 75% of the country’s electricity.\n\nAustralia depended on hydro power for just under 25% of its electricity in both years, but the amount of electricity produced using this type of power fell from 5 to only 2 units in France. Oil, on the other hand, remained a relatively important fuel source inFrance, but its use declined in Australia. Both countries relied on natural gas for electricity production significantly more in 1980 than in 2000.\n\n\n# Simon S118\n\nThe chart gives information about UK immigration, emigration and net migration between 1999 and 2008. Both immigration and emigration rates rose over the period shown, but the figures for immigration were significantly higher. Net migration peaked in 2004 and 2007.\n\nIn 1999, over 450,000 people came to live in the UK, while the number of people who emigrated stood at just under 300,000. The figure for net migration was around 160,000, and it remained at a similar level until 2003. From 1999 to 2004, the immigration rate rose by nearly 150,000 people, but there was a much smaller rise in emigration. Net migration peaked at almost 250,000 people in 2004.\n\nAfter 2004, the rate of immigration remained high, but the number of people emigrating fluctuated. Emigration fell suddenly in 2007, before peaking at about 420,000 people in 2008. As a result, the net migration figure rose to around 240,000 in 2007, but fell back to around 160,000 in 2008.\n\n\n# Simon S119\n\nIt is clear from the charts that the figures for developed countries are much higher than those for developing nations. Also, the charts show an overall increase in participation in education and science from 1980 to 1990.\n\nPeople in developing nations attended school for an average of around 3 years, with only a slight increase in years of schooling from 1980 to 1990. On the other hand, the figure for industrialised countries rose from nearly 9 years of schooling in 1980 to nearly 11 years in 1990.\n\nFrom 1980 to 1990, the number of scientists and technicians in industrialised countries almost doubled to about 70 per 1000 people. Spending on research and development also saw rapid growth in these countries, reaching 350 billion in 1990. By contrast, the number of science workers in developing countries remained below 20 per 1000 people, and research spending fell from about 50 billion to only 25 billion.\n\n\n# Simon S120\n\nThe figure illustrates the process used by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology to forecast the weather.\n\nThere are four stages in the process, beginning with the collection of information about the weather. This information is then analysed, prepared for presentation, and finally broadcast to the public.\n\nLooking at the first and second stages of the process, there are three ways of collecting weather data and three ways of analysing it. Firstly, incoming information can be received by satellite and presented for analysis as a satellite photo. The same data can also be passed to a radar station and presented on a radar screen or synoptic chart. Secondly, incoming information may be collected directly by radar and analysed on a radar screen or synoptic chart. Finally, drifting buoys also receive data which can be shown on a synoptic chart.\n\nAt the third stage of the process, the weather broadcast is prepared on computers. Finally, it is delivered to the public on television, on the radio, or as a recorded telephone announcement.\n\n\n# Simon S121\n\nThe line graph compares the percentage of people in three countries who used the Internet between 1999 and 2009.\n\nIt is clear that the proportion of the population who used the Internet increased in each country over the period shown. Overall, a much larger percentage of Canadians and Americans had access to the Internet in comparison with Mexicans, and Canada experienced the fastest growth in Internet usage.\n\nIn 1999, the proportion of people using the Internet in the USA was about 20%. The figures for Canada and Mexico were lower, at about 10% and 5% respectively. In 2005, Internet usage in both the USA and Canada rose to around 70% of the population, while the figure for Mexico reached just over 25%.\n\nBy 2009, the percentage of Internet users was highest in Canada. Almost 100% of Canadians used the Internet, compared to about 80% of Americans and only 40% of Mexicans.\n\n\n# Simon S122\n\nThe map shows the growth of a village called Chorleywood between 1868 and 1994. It is clear that the village grew as the transport infrastructure was improved. Four periods of development are shown on the map, and each of the populated areas is near to the main roads, the railway or the motorway.\n\nFrom 1868 to 1883, Chorleywood covered a small area next to one of the main roads. Chorleywood Park and Golf Course is now located next to this original village area. The village grew along the main road to the south between 1883 and 1922, and in 1909 a railway line was built crossing this area from west to east. Chorleywood station is in this part of the village.\n\nThe expansion of Chorleywood continued to the east and west alongside the railway line until 1970. At that time, a motorway was built to the east of the village, and from 1970 to 1994, further development of the village took place around motorway intersections with the railway and one of the main roads.",normalizedContent:"# simon s101\n\nthe line graph compares average yearly spending by americans on mobile and landline phone services from 2001 to 2010.\n\n折线图比较了2001年至2010年间美国人在移动电话和固定电话服务上的平均年度支出。\n\nit is clear that spending on landline phones fell steadily over the 10-year period, while mobile phone expenditure rose quickly. the year 2006 marks the point at which expenditure on mobile services overtook that for residential phone services.\n\n很明显，在这10年间，固定电话的支出稳步下降，而移动电话的支出迅速增加。2006年是移动服务支出超过住宅电话服务支出的时间点。\n\nin 2001, us consumers spent an average of nearly $700 on residential phone services, compared to only around $200 on cell phone services. over the following five years, average yearly spending on landlines dropped by nearly $200. by contrast, expenditure on mobiles rose by approximately $300.\n\n2001年，美国消费者在住宅电话服务上的平均支出接近700美元，而在手机服务上的支出仅约200美元。在接下来的五年里，固定电话的平均年度支出减少了近200美元。相比之下，移动电话的支出增加了约300美元。\n\nin the year 2006, the average american paid out the same amount of money on both types of phone service, spending just over $500 on each. by 2010, expenditure on mobile phones had reached around $750, while the figure for spending on residential services had fallen to just over half this amount.\n\n2006年，美国人在这两种电话服务上的支出金额相同，每种支出刚超过500美元。到2010年，手机支出达到约750美元，而住宅服务的支出则降至此数额的一半多一点。\n\n\n# simon s102\n\nthe diagram illustrates the various stages in the life of a honey bee. we can see that the complete life cycle lasts between 34 and 36 days. it is also noticeable that there are five main stages in the development of the honey bee, from egg to mature adult insect.\n\n图表展示了蜜蜂生命周期的各个阶段。可以看出，蜜蜂的完整生命周期持续34至36天。同样值得注意的是，蜜蜂的发展从卵到成熟成虫共有五个主要阶段。\n\nthe life cycle of the honey bee begins when the female adult lays an egg; the female typically lays one or two eggs every 3 days. between 9 and 10 days later, each egg hatches and the immature insect, or nymph, appears.\n\n蜜蜂的生命周期开始于成年雌蜂产卵；雌蜂通常每3天产一到两个卵。在9到10天后，每个卵孵化，出现幼虫（若虫）。\n\nduring the third stage of the life cycle, the nymph grows in size and sheds its skin three times. this moulting first takes place 5 days after the egg hatches, then 7 days later, and again another 9 days later. after a total of 30 to 31 days from the start of the cycle, the young adult honey bee emerges from its final moulting stage, and in the space of only 4 days it reaches full maturity.\n\n在生命周期的第三阶段，若虫体积增大并蜕皮三次。第一次蜕皮发生在卵孵化后5天，然后是7天后，再次是再过9天。从周期开始后总共30到31天，年轻的成年蜜蜂从最后一次蜕皮阶段出现，在短短4天内达到完全成熟。\n\n\n# simon s103\n\nthe chart

between may and june. figures for precipitation remain above 250mm from june to september, peaking at around 330mm in july. the final three months of the year see a dramatic fall in precipitation, to a low of about 10mm in december, and a steady drop in temperatures back to the january average.\n\n尽管接下来四个月的温度大致相同，但5月到6月间的降雨量增加了一倍以上。6月至9月的降水量保持在250毫米以上，7月达到约330毫米的高峰。年底最后三个月降水量急剧下降，到12月降至约10毫米，并且温度稳步回落至1月的平均水平。\n\n\n# simon s104\n\nthe bar charts compare students of different ages in terms of why they are studying and whether they are supported by an employer.\n\n条形图比较了不同年龄的学生在为什么学习以及是否得到雇主支持方面的差异。\n\nit is clear that the proportion of students who study for career purposes is far higher among the younger age groups, while the oldest students are more likely to study for interest. employer support is more commonly given to younger students.\n\n显然，为职业目的学习的学生比例在年轻年龄组中远高于其他组，而最年长的学生更可能因兴趣而学习。雇主的支持更多地给予年轻学生。\n\naround 80% of students aged under 26 study to further their careers, whereas only 10% study purely out of interest. the gap between these two proportions narrows as students get older, and the figures for those in their forties are the same, at about 40%. students aged over 49 overwhelmingly study for interest (70%) rather than for professional reasons (less than 20%).\n\n大约80%的26岁以下学生为了进一步发展其职业而学习，而只有10%的学生纯粹出于兴趣而学习。这两个比例之间的差距随着学生年龄的增长而缩小，四十多岁的学生比例相同，约为40%。49岁以上的学生绝大多数是因兴趣（70%）而非职业原因（少于20%）而学习。\n\njust over 60% of students aged under 26 are supported by their employers. by contrast, the 30-39 age group is the most self-sufficient, with only 30% being given time off and help with fees. the figures rise slightly for students in their forties and for those aged 50 or more.\n\n超过60%的26岁以下学生得到了雇主的支持。相比之下，30-39岁的年龄组最为自给自足，只有30%的人获得了休假和费用帮助。四十多岁的学生和50岁以上的学生的数字略有上升。\n\n\n# simon s105\n\nthe bar chart compares the number of incidents and injuries for every 100 million passenger miles traveled on five different types of public transport in 2002.\n\n条形图比较了2002年五种不同公共交通方式每一亿乘客英里旅行中发生的事故和伤害数量。\n\nit is clear that the most incidents and injuries took place on demand-response vehicles. by contrast, commuter rail services recorded by far the lowest figures.\n\n很明显，需求响应型车辆发生了最多的事故和伤害。相比之下，通勤铁路服务的数字远远最低。\n\na total of 225 incidents and 173 injuries, per 100 million passenger miles traveled, took place on demand-response transport services. these figures were nearly three times as high as those for the second highest category, bus services. there were 76 incidents and 66 people were injured on buses.\n\n在需求响应型交通服务上，每一亿乘客英里旅行中共发生了225起事故和173起伤害。这些数字几乎是第二高类别，即公交服务数字的三倍。公交车上发生了76起事故，66人受伤。\n\nrail services experienced fewer problems. the number of incidents on light rail trains equaled the figure recorded for buses, but there were significantly fewer injuries, at only 39. heavy rail services saw lower numbers of such events than light rail services, but commuter rail passengers were even less likely to experience problems. in fact, only 20 incidents and 17 injuries occurred on commuter trains.\n\n铁路服务遇到的问题较少。轻轨列车的事故数量与公交车记录的数字相等，但受伤人数显著较少，仅为39人。重轨服务的此类事件数量低于轻轨服务，但通勤铁路乘客遇到问题的可能性更小。实际上，通勤列车仅发生了20起事故和17起伤害。\n\n\n# simon s106\n\nthe line graph compares the percentage of people aged 65 or more in three countries over a period of 100 years. it is clear that the proportion of elderly people increases in each country between 1940 and 2040. japan is expected to see the most dramatic changes in its elderly population.\n\n折线图比较了三个国家中65岁及以上人口的百分比，时间跨度为100年。很明显，在1940年到2040年间，每个国家的老年人口比例都在增加。预计日本在老年人口中将看到最剧烈的变化。\n\nin 1940, around 9% of americans were aged 65 or over, compared to about 7% of swedish people and 5% of japanese people. the proportions of elderly people in the usa and sweden rose gradually over the next 50 years, reaching just under 15% in 1990. by contrast, the figures for japan remained below 5% until the early 2000s.\n\n1940年，大约9%的美国人年龄在65岁以上，相比之下，约7%的瑞典人和5%的日本人。在接下来的50年里，美国和瑞典的老年人口比例逐渐上升，到1990年接近15%。相比之下，日本的数据直到21世纪初仍然低于5%。\n\nlooking into the future, a sudden increase in the percentage of elderly people is predicted for japan, with a jump of over 15% in just 10 years from 2030 to 2040. by 2040, it is thought that around 27% of the japanese population will be 65 years old or more, while the figures for sweden and the usa will be slightly lower, at about 25% and 23% respectively.\n\n展望未来，预计日本的老年人口比例将突然增加，在2030年到2040年的10年间增加超过15%。预计到2040年，约27%的日本人将年满65岁或以上，而瑞典和美国的数据将略低，分别约为25%和23%。\n\n\n# simon s107\n\nthe table shows percentages of consumer expenditure for three categories of products and services in five countries in 2002.\n\n该表显示了2002年五个国家在三类产品和服务上的消费支出百分比。\n\nit is clear that the largest proportion of consumer spending in each country went on food, drinks, and tobacco. on the other hand, the leisure/education category has the lowest percentages in the table. out of the five countries, consumer spending on food, drinks, and tobacco was noticeably higher in turkey, at 32.14%, and ireland, at nearly 29%. the proportion of spending on leisure and education was also highest in turkey, at 4.35%, while expenditure on clothing and footwear was significantly higher in italy, at 9%, than in any of the other countries.\n\n很明显，每个国家的消费支出中食品、饮料和烟草的比例最大。另一方面，休闲/教育类别在表中的百分比最低。在这五个国家中，土耳其和爱尔兰在食品、饮料和烟草上的消费支出明显较高，分别为32.14%和近29%。在休闲和教育方面的支出比例，土耳其也是最高的，为4.35%，而意大利在服装和鞋类的支出上明显高于其他国家，为9%。\n\nit can be seen that sweden had the lowest percentages of national consumer expenditure for food/drinks/tobacco and for clothing/footwear, at nearly 16% and just over 5% respectively. spain had slightly higher figures for these categories, but the lowest figure for leisure/education, at only 1.98%.\n\n可以看出，瑞典在食品/饮料/烟草和服装/鞋类的国民消费支出百分比最低，分别为近16%和略高于5%。西班牙在这些类别的数字略高，但在休闲/教育方面的数字最低，仅为1.98%。\n\n\n# simon s108\n\nthe charts compare the amount of water used for agriculture, industry and homes around the world, and water use in brazil and the democratic republic of congo.\n\nit is clear that global water needs rose significantly between 1900 and 2000, and that agriculture accounted for the largest proportion of water used. we can also see that water consumption was considerably higher in brazil than in the congo.\n\nin 1900, around 500km³ of water was used by the agriculture sector worldwide. the figures for industrial and domestic water consumption stood at around one fifth of that amount. by 2000, global water use for agriculture had increased to around 3000km³, industrial water use had risen to just under half that amount, and domestic consumption had reached approximately 500km³.\n\nin the year 2000, the populations of brazil and the congo were 176 million and 5.2 million respectively. water consumption per person in brazil, at 359m³, was much higher than that in the congo, at only 8m³, and this could be explained by the fact that brazil had 265 times more irrigated land.\n\n\n# simon s109\n\nthe bar chart compares the cost of an average house in five major cities over aperiod of 13 years from 1989. we can see that house prices fell overall between 1990 and 1995, but most of the cities saw rising prices between 1996 and 2002. london experienced by far the greatest changes in house prices over the 13-year period.\n\nover the 5 years after 1989, the cost of average homes in tokyo and london dropped by around 7%, while new york house prices went down by 5%. by contrast, prices rose by approximately 2% in both madrid and frankfurt.\n\nbetween 1996 and 2002, london house prices jumped to around 12% above the 1989 average. homebuyers in new york also had to pay significantly more, with prices rising to 5% above the 1989 average, but homes in tokyo remained cheaper than they were in 1989. the cost of an average home in madrid rose by a further 2%, while prices in frankfurt remained stable.\n\n\n# simon s110\n\nit is noticeable that levels of poverty were higher for single people than for couples, and people with children were more likely to be poor than those without. poverty rates were considerably lower among elderly people.\n\noverall, 11% of australians, or 1,837,000 people, were living in poverty in 1999. aged people were the least likely to be poor, with poverty levels of 6% and 4% for single aged people and aged couples respectively.\n\njust over one fifth of single parents were living in poverty, whereas only 12% of parents living with a partner were classed as poor. the same pattern can be seen for people with no children: while 19% of single people in this group were living below the poverty line, the figure for couples was much lower, at only 7%.\n\n\n# simon s111\n\nthe main difference between the two sites is that s1 is outside the town, whereas s2 is in the town centre. the sites can also be compared in terms of access by road or rail, and their positions relative to three smaller towns.\n\nlooking at the information in more detail, s1 is in the countryside to the northwest of garlsdon, but it is close to the residential area of the town. s2 is also close to the housing area, which surrounds the town centre.\n\nthere are main roads from hindon, bransdon and cransdon to garlsdon town centre, but this is a no traffic zone, so there would be no access to s2 by car. by contrast, s1 lies on the main road to hindon, but it would be more difficult to reach from bransdon and cransdon. both supermarket sites are close to the railway that runs through garlsdon from hindon to cransdon.\n\n\n# simon s112\n\nthe bar chart compares consumer spending on six different items in germany, italy, france and britain.\n\nit is clear that british people spent significantly more money than people in the other three countries on all six goods. of the six items, consumers spent the most money on photographic film.\n\npeople in britain spent just over £170,000 on photographic film, which is the highest figure shown on the chart. by contrast, germans were the lowest overall spenders, with roughly the same figures (just under £150,000) for each of the six products.\n\nthe figures for spending on toys were the same in both france and italy, at nearly £160,000. however, while french people spent more than italians on photographic film and cds, italians paid out more for personal stereos, tennis racquets and perfumes. the amount spent by french people on tennis racquets, around £145,000, is the lowest figure shown on the chart.\n\n\n# simon s113\n\nthe diagrams show how house designs differ according to climate. the most noticeable difference between houses designed for cool and warm climates is in the shape of the roof. the designs also differ with regard to the windows and the use of insulation.\n\nwe can see that the cool climate house has a high-angled roof, which allows sunlight to enter through the window. by contrast, the roof of the warm climate house has a peak in the middle and roof overhangs to shade the windows. insulation and thermal building materials are used in cool climates to reduce heat loss, whereas insulation and reflective materials are used to keep the heat out in warm climates.\n\nfinally, the cool climate house has one window which faces the direction of the sun, while the warm climate house has windows on two sides which are shaded from the sun. by opening the two windows at night, the house designed for warm climates can be ventilated.\n\n\n# simon s114\n\nthe picture illustrates the way in which water passes from ocean to air to land during the natural process known as the water cycle.\n\nthree main stages are shown on the diagram. ocean water evaporates, falls as rain, and eventually runs back into the oceans again.\n\nbeginning at the evaporation stage, we can see that 80% of water vapour in the air comes from the oceans. heat from the sun causes water to evaporate, and water vapour condenses to form clouds. at the second stage, labelled ‘precipitation’ on the diagram, water falls as rain or snow.\n\nat the third stage in the cycle, rainwater may take various paths. some of it may fall into lakes or return to the oceans via ‘surface runoff’. otherwise, rainwater may filter through the ground, reaching the impervious layer of the earth. salt water intrusion is shown to take place just before groundwater passes into the oceans to complete the cycle.\n\n\n# simon s115\n\nthe first picture shows the layout of an art gallery, and the second shows some proposed changes to the gallery space.\n\nit is clear that significant changes will be made in terms of the use of floor space in the gallery. there will be a completely new entrance and more space for exhibitions.\n\nat present, visitors enter the gallery through doors which lead into a lobby. however, the plan is to move the entrance to the parkinson court side of the building, and visitors will walk straight into the exhibition area. in place of the lobby and office areas, which are shown on the existing plan, the new gallery plan shows an education area and a small storage area.\n\nthe permanent exhibition space in the redeveloped gallery will be about twice as large as it is now because it will occupy the area that is now used for temporary exhibitions. there will also be a new room for special exhibitions. this room is shown in red on the existing plan and is not currently part of the gallery.\n\n\n# simon s116\n\nthe table compares the six networks in terms of their age, size and the number of people who use them each year. it is clear that the three oldest underground systems are larger and serve significantly more passengers than the newer systems.\n\nthe london underground is the oldest system, having opened in 1863. it is also the largest system, with 394 kilometres of route. the second largest system, in paris, is only about half the size of the london underground, with 199 kilometres of route. however, it serves more people per year. while only third in terms of size, the tokyo system is easily the most used, with 1927 million passengers per year.\n\nof the three newer networks, the washington dc underground is the most extensive, with 126 kilometres of route, compared to only 11 kilometres and 28 kilometres for the kyoto and los angeles systems. the los angeles network is the newest, having opened in 2001, while the kyoto network is the smallest and serves only 45 million passengers per year.\n\n\n# simon s117\n\nthe pie charts compare the amount of electricity produced using five different sources of fuel in two countries over two separate years.\n\ntotal electricity production increased dramatically from 1980 to 2000 in both australia and france. while the totals for both countries were similar, there were big differences in the fuel sources used.\n\ncoal was used to produce 50 of the total 100 units of electricity in australia in 1980, rising to 130 out of 170 units in 2000. by contrast, nuclear power became the most important fuel source in france in 2000, producing almost 75% of the country’s electricity.\n\naustralia depended on hydro power for just under 25% of its electricity in both years, but the amount of electricity produced using this type of power fell from 5 to only 2 units in france. oil, on the other hand, remained a relatively important fuel source infrance, but its use declined in australia. both countries relied on natural gas for electricity production significantly more in 1980 than in 2000.\n\n\n# simon s118\n\nthe chart gives information about uk immigration, emigration and net migration between 1999 and 2008. both immigration and emigration rates rose over the period shown, but the figures for immigration were significantly higher. net migration peaked in 2004 and 2007.\n\nin 1999, over 450,000 people came to live in the uk, while the number of people who emigrated stood at just under 300,000. the figure for net migration was around 160,000, and it remained at a similar level until 2003. from 1999 to 2004, the immigration rate rose by nearly 150,000 people, but there was a much smaller rise in emigration. net migration peaked at almost 250,000 people in 2004.\n\nafter 2004, the rate of immigration remained high, but the number of people emigrating fluctuated. emigration fell suddenly in 2007, before peaking at about 420,000 people in 2008. as a result, the net migration figure rose to around 240,000 in 2007, but fell back to around 160,000 in 2008.\n\n\n# simon s119\n\nit is clear from the charts that the figures for developed countries are much higher than those for developing nations. also, the charts show an overall increase in participation in education and science from 1980 to 1990.\n\npeople in developing nations attended school for an average of around 3 years, with only a slight increase in years of schooling from 1980 to 1990. on the other hand, the figure for industrialised countries rose from nearly 9 years of schooling in 1980 to nearly 11 years in 1990.\n\nfrom 1980 to 1990, the number of scientists and technicians in industrialised countries almost doubled to about 70 per 1000 people. spending on research and development also saw rapid growth in these countries, reaching 350 billion in 1990. by contrast, the number of science workers in developing countries remained below 20 per 1000 people, and research spending fell from about 50 billion to only 25 billion.\n\n\n# simon s120\n\nthe figure illustrates the process used by the australian bureau of meteorology to forecast the weather.\n\nthere are four stages in the process, beginning with the collection of information about the weather. this information is then analysed, prepared for presentation, and finally broadcast to the public.\n\nlooking at the first and second stages of the process, there are three ways of collecting weather data and three ways of analysing it. firstly, incoming information can be received by satellite and presented for analysis as a satellite photo. the same data can also be passed to a radar station and presented on a radar screen or synoptic chart. secondly, incoming information may be collected directly by radar and analysed on a radar screen or synoptic chart. finally, drifting buoys also receive data which can be shown on a synoptic chart.\n\nat the third stage of the process, the weather broadcast is prepared on computers. finally, it is delivered to the public on television, on the radio, or as a recorded telephone announcement.\n\n\n# simon s121\n\nthe line graph compares the percentage of people in three countries who used the internet between 1999 and 2009.\n\nit is clear that the proportion of the population who used the internet increased in each country over the period shown. overall, a much larger percentage of canadians and americans had access to the internet in comparison with mexicans, and canada experienced the fastest growth in internet usage.\n\nin 1999, the proportion of people using the internet in the usa was about 20%. the figures for canada and mexico were lower, at about 10% and 5% respectively. in 2005, internet usage in both the usa and canada rose to around 70% of the population, while the figure for mexico reached just over 25%.\n\nby 2009, the percentage of internet users was highest in canada. almost 100% of canadians used the internet, compared to about 80% of americans and only 40% of mexicans.\n\n\n# simon s122\n\nthe map shows the growth of a village called chorleywood between 1868 and 1994. it is clear that the village grew as the transport infrastructure was improved. four periods of development are shown on the map, and each of the populated areas is near to the main roads, the railway or the motorway.\n\nfrom 1868 to 1883, chorleywood covered a small area next to one of the main roads. chorleywood park and golf course is now located next to this original village area. the village grew along the main road to the south between 1883 and 1922, and in 1909 a railway line was built crossing this area from west to east. chorleywood station is in this part of the village.\n\nthe expansion of chorleywood continued to the east and west alongside the railway line until 1970. at that time, a motorway was built to the east of the village, and from 1970 to 1994, further development of the village took place around motorway intersections with the railway and one of the main roads.",charsets:{cjk:!0},lastUpdated:"2025/05/30  09:15:02",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1748567702e3},{title:"Speaking Reference",frontmatter:{title:"Speaking

This migration has led to a significant depopulation of the rural areas, causing many negative feelings about urbanization. However, in my opinion, this is a positive phenomenon.\n\nIt is true that the depopulation in the countryside causecauses many social problemproblems, such as a lack of laber and badpoor infustructure.

Becaue I believe that other factors play an equally significant role and should not be overlooked. Focusing too heavily on financial gain as a motivation for employment can leave a negative impression on potential employers, potentially hindering one's chances of securing higher-paying opportunities.\n\n首先来说，我所说的金钱不是最重要的不等于金钱不重要，相反钱的重要程度是远超其他因素的，因为在当今的市场经济背景下，钱是维持人日常生活的必需品。例如，我们都需要钱来支付住房、食物、信用卡账单、医疗和教育。一份能赚取覆盖这些需求，并拥有合理生活质量的薪水是必然是要优先考虑的，同时工资的高与低很大程度上代表了公司的好与坏，好的公司通常更愿意给员工更好的待遇和福利，这使得工资成为了一个很好的衡量公司好坏的标准。如果人们基于享受或其他非财务因素选择工作，他们可能会发现很难维持生活。例如，艺术家和音乐家以选择自己热爱的职业道路而闻名，但这并不总是能为他们提供足够的资金来舒适地生活和抚养家庭。\n\nFirst and foremost, while I assert that money is not the most crucial factor, it does not mean that it is unimportant. On the contrary, in the context of today's economic environment, money significantly surpasses other factors because it is essential for maintaining daily life. For instance, we all need money to pay for housing, food, credit card bills, medical care, and education. A salary that covers these needs and provides a reasonable quality of life must naturally be a priority. Furthermore, the level of wages often reflects the quality of a company; better companies usually offer better compensation and benefits to their employees, making salary a good measure of a company’s standing. However, if individuals choose jobs based on passion or other non-financial factors alone, they may find it challenging to sustain a living. For example, artists and musicians are known for pursuing careers driven by passion, yet this does not always provide them with sufficient funds to live comfortably or support a family.\n\n然而，我认为还有很多其他因素和收入同样重要。首先，个人关系和工作场所的氛围在选择工作时极为重要。例如，拥有一位好的经理或友好的同事，可以极大地影响工人的幸福感和总体生活质量。其次，许多人的工作满意感来自于他们的职业成就、他们学到的技能以及他们工作中获得的社会声望，赚到了钱只是其中的一部分。最后，一些人选择职业是因为他们想帮助他人并为社会做出积极贡献。\n\nHowever, I believe there are many other factors that are equally important as income. Firstly, personal relationships and the workplace atmosphere are crucial when choosing a job. For example, having a good manager or friendly colleagues can greatly enhance one's sense of well-being and overall quality of life. Secondly, many people derive job satisfaction from their professional achievements, the skills they acquire, and the social prestige they gain from their work, where earning money is just one part of the equation. Lastly, some individuals choose their careers because they wish to help others and make a positive contribution to society.\n\n总之，尽管薪水确实影响人们的职业选择，但我不认为金钱超过所有其他择业因素。\n\nIn conclusion, although salary

Why could this be? Should governments give more financial support to local film industries?\n\nIt is true that foreign films are more popular in many countries than domestically produced films. There could be several reasons why this is the case, and I believe that governments should promote local film-making by subsidizing the industry.\n\n确实，在许多国家，外国电影比国产电影更受欢迎。这可能是由几个原因造成的，我认为政府应该通过补贴产业来推动本地电影制作。\n\nThere are various reasons why many people find foreign films more enjoyable than the films produced in their own countries. Firstly, the established film industries in certain countries have huge budgets for action, special effects and to shoot scenes in spectacular locations. Hollywood blockbusters like ‘Avatar’ or the James Bond films are examples of such productions and the global appeal that they have. Another reason why these big-budget films are so successful is that they often star the most famous actors and actresses, and they are made by the most accomplished producers and directors. The poor quality, low-budget filmmaking in many countries suffers in comparison.\n\n许多人觉得外国电影比他们自己国家制作的电影更有趣的原因有很多。首先，某些国家的成熟电影产业拥有巨额预算用于动作场面、特效以及在壮观的地点拍摄场景。像《阿凡达》或詹姆斯·邦德电影这样的好莱坞大片就是此类制作的例子，以及它们所拥有的全球吸引力。这些大预算电影之所以如此成功，另一个原因是它们经常由最著名的演员和女演员主演，并由最有成就的制片人和导演制作。相比之下，许多国家的低质量、低成本的电影制作就显得逊色了。\n\nIn my view, governments should support local film industries financially. In every country, there may be talented amateur film-makers who just need to be given the opportunity to prove themselves. To compete with big-budget productions from overseas, these people need money to pay for film crews, actors and a host of other costs related to producing high-quality films. If governments did help with these costs, they would see an increase in employment in the film industry, income from film sales, and perhaps even a rise in tourist numbers. New Zealand, for example, has seen an increase in tourism related to the 'Lord of the Rings' films, which were partly funded by government subsidies.\n\n在我看来，政府应该在财务上支持本地电影产业。在每个国家，都可能有才华横溢的业余电影制作者，他们只是需要机会来证明自己。为了与海外的大预算制作竞争，这些人需要资金来支付电影工作人员、演员以及与制作高质量电影相关的其他一系列费用。如果政府帮助承担这些费用，他们将看到电影产业的就业增加、电影销售收入增加，甚至可能会看到游客数量上升。例如，新西兰就因为部分由政府补贴的《指环王》电影而见证了旅游业的增长。\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that increased financial support could help to raise the quality of locally made films and allow them to compete with the foreign productions that currently dominate the market.\n\n总之，我相信增加财务支持可以帮助提高本地制作电影的质量，并使它们能够与目前主导市场的外国制作竞争。\n\n\n# Simon S202 外国游客应该比本地游客花更多钱\n\nForeign visitors should pay more than local visitors for cultural and historical attractions. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?\n\nIt is sometimes argued that tourists from overseas should be charged more than local residents to visit important sites and monuments. I completely disagree with this idea.\n\n有时候有人认为，来自海外的游客在参观重要的景点和纪念碑时，应该比当地居民支付更多的费用。我完全不同意这个观点。\n\nThe argument in favour of higher prices for foreign tourists would be that cultural or historical attractions often depend on state subsidies to keep them going, which means that the resident population already pays money to these sites through the tax system. However, I believe this to be a very shortsighted view. Foreign tourists contribute to the economy of the host country with the money they spend on a wide range of goods and services, including food, souvenirs, accommodation, and travel. The governments and inhabitants of every country should be happy to subsidise important tourist sites and encourage people from the rest of the world to visit them.\n\n支持对外国游客收取更高价格的论点是，文化或历史景点通常依赖国家补贴来维持运营，这意味着居民通过税收系统已经为这些景点支付了费用。然而，我认为这是一种非常短视的观点。外国游客通过在食品、纪念品、住宿和旅行等广泛的商品和服务上的消费为东道国的经济作出贡献。每个国家的政府和居民都应该乐于为重要的旅游景点提供补贴，并鼓励世界其他地方的人们来访。\n\nIf travellers realised that they would have to pay more to visit historical and cultural attractions in a particular nation, they would perhaps decide not to go to that country on holiday. To take the UK as an example, the tourism industry and many related jobs rely on visitors coming to the country to see places like Windsor Castle or Saint Paul’s Cathedral. These two sites charge the same price regardless of nationality, and this helps to promote the nation’s cultural heritage. If overseas tourists stopped coming due to higher prices, there would be a risk of insufficient funding for the maintenance of these important buildings.\n\n如果游客意识到他们必须支付更多的费用才能参观某个国家的历史和文化景点，他们可能会决定不去那个国家度假。以英国为例，旅游业及许多相关工作依赖于游客来到该国参观温莎城堡或圣保罗大教堂等地方。这两个地点无论国籍都是同一价格，这有助于推广国家的文化遗产。如果由于价格较高而导致海外游客停止来访，那么这些重要建筑的维护资金可能会不足。\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that every effort should be made to attract tourists from overseas, and it would be counterproductive to make them pay more than local residents.\n\n总之，我认为应该尽一切努力吸引海外游客，让他们支付比当地居民更多的费用将是适得其反的。\n\n\n# Simon S203 现代社会的人变得更独立还是更不独立\n\nSome people think that in the modern world we are more dependent on each other, while others think that people have become more independent.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.\n\nPeople have different views about whether we are more or less dependent on others nowadays. In my view, modern life forces us to be more independent than people were in the past.\n\n现代人对于我们现在是否比以前更依赖他人持有不同观点。在我看来，现代生活迫使我们比过去更加独立。\n\nThere are two main reasons why it could be argued that we are more dependent on each other now. Firstly, life is more complex and difficult, especially because the cost of living has increased so dramatically. For example, young adults tend to rely on their parents for help when buying a house. Property prices are higher than ever, and without help it would be impossible for many people to pay a deposit and a mortgage. Secondly, people seem to be more ambitious nowadays, and they want a better quality of life for their families. This means that both parents usually need to work full-time, and they depend on support from grandparents and babysitters for child care.\n\n现在我们更相互依赖的主要有两个原因。首先，生活变得更加复杂和困难，特别是生活成本显著增加。例如，年轻人在购买房屋时往往依靠父母的帮助。房价比以往任何时候都高，没有帮助，许多人将无法支付定金和抵押贷款。其次，现在的人似乎更有野心，他们希望为家庭提供更好的生活质量。这意味着父母通常需要全职工作，他们依靠祖父母和保姆来帮助照顾孩子。\n\nHowever, I would agree with those who believe that people are more independent these days. In most countries, families are becoming smaller and more dispersed, which means that people cannot count on relatives as much as they used to. We also have more freedom to travel and live far away from our home towns. For example, many students choose to study abroad instead of going to their local university, and this experience makes them more independent as they learn to live alone. Another factor in this growing independence is technology, which allows us to work alone and from any part of the world.\n\n然而，我同意那些认为现在的人更独立的人。在大多数国家，家庭变得更小且更分散，这意味着人们不能像以前那样依赖亲戚。我们也有更多的自由去旅行和远离家乡生活。例如，许多学生选择出国留学而不是去本地大学，这种经历使他们在学会独立生活时变得更加独立。这种日益增长的独立性的另一个因素是技术，它使我们能够独自一人并在世界任何地方工作。\n\nIn conclusion, while there are some reasons to believe that people now depend on each other more, my own view is that we are more independent than ever.\n\n总之，虽然有些理由让人相信现在的人们更加相互依赖，但我个人认为我们比以往任何时候都更独立。\n\n\n# Simon S204 选择工作最重要的考虑因素是薪水\n\nWhen choosing a job, the salary is the most important consideration. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nMany people choose their jobs based on the size of the salary offered. Personally, I disagree with the idea that money is the key consideration when deciding on a career, because I believe that other factors are equally important.\n\n人们对于现代生活中我们是否比以前更依赖他人这个问题持有不同的看法。在我看来，现代生活迫使我们比过去的人更加独立。\n\nOn the one hand, I agree that money is necessary in order for people to meet their basic needs. For example, we all need money to pay for housing, food, bills, health care, and education. Most people consider it a priority to at least earn a salary that allows them to cover these needs and have a reasonable quality of life. If people chose their jobs based on enjoyment or other non-financial factors, they might find it difficult to support themselves. Artists and musicians, for instance, are known for choosing a career path that they love, but that does not always provide them with enough money to live comfortably and raise a family.\n\n有两个主要原因可以解释为什么我们现在可能更依赖彼此。首先，生活变得更加复杂和困难，尤其是因为生活成本的显著增加。例如，年轻成年人在购买房屋时往往依赖父母的帮助。房产价格比以往任何时候都高，没有帮助的话，许多人支付首付和按揭贷款是不可能的。其次，现在的人们似乎更有野心，他们希望为家庭提供更好的生活质量。这意味着父母通常需要全职工作，他们依赖祖父母和保姆来照顾孩子。\n\nNevertheless, I believe that other considerations are just as important as what we earn in our jobs. Firstly, personal relationships and the atmosphere in a workplace are extremely important when choosing a job. Having a good manager or friendly colleagues, for example, can make a huge difference to workers’ levels of happiness and general quality of life. Secondly, many people’s feelings of job satisfaction come from their professional achievements, the skills they learn, and the position they reach, rather than the money they earn. Finally, some people choose a career because they want to help others and contribute something positive to society.\n\n然而，我同意那些认为现在的人更加独立的人。在大多数国家，家庭变得更小、更分散，这意味着人们不能像以前那样依靠亲戚。我们也有更多的自由去旅行，远离家乡生活。例如，许多学生选择出国留学而不是去当地的大学，这种经历使他们学会独自生活，变得更加独立。这种日益增长的独立性的另一个因素是技术，它允许我们独自工作，从世界任何地方工作。\n\nIn conclusion, while salaries certainly affect people’s choice of profession, I do not believe that money outweighs all other motivators.\n\n总之，虽然有一些理由认为现在的人更依赖彼此，但我个人认为我们比以往任何时候都更加独立。\n\n\n# Simon S205动物实验是否应该禁止\n\nNowadays animal experiments are widely used to develop new medicines and to test the safety of other products. Some people argue that these experiments should be banned because it is morally wrong to cause animals to suffer, while others are in favour of them because of their benefits to humanity. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.\n\nIt is true that medicines and other products are routinely tested on animals before they are cleared for human use. While I tend towards the viewpoint that animal testing is morally wrong, I would have to support a limited amount of animal experimentation for the development of medicines.\n\n确实，在药物和其他产品被批准用于人类之前，通常会对动物进行测试。虽然我倾向于认为动物实验在道德上是错误的，但我必须支持为了药物开发而进行的有限数量的动物实验。\n\nOn the one hand, there are clear ethical arguments against animal experimentation. To use a common example of this practice, laboratory mice may be given an illness so that the effectiveness of a new drug can be measured. Opponents of such research argue that humans have no right to subject animals to this kind of trauma, and that the lives of all creatures should be respected. They believe that the benefits to humans do not justify the suffering caused, and that scientists should use alternative methods of research.\n\n一方面，反对动物实验有明显的伦理论点。以这一做法的一个常见例子来说，实验室的老鼠可能会被赋予一种疾病，以便可以测量新药的效果。反对此类研究的人士认为，人类无权让动物承受这种创伤，所有生物的生命都应该受到尊重。他们认为，对人类的好处并不足以证明造成的痛苦，科学家应该使用研究的其他方法。\n\nOn the other hand, reliable alternatives to animal experimentation may not always be available. Supporters of the use of animals in medical research believe that a certain amount of suffering on the part of mice or rats can be justified if human lives are saved. They argue that opponents of such research might feel differently if a member of their own families needed a medical treatment that had been developed through the use of animal experimentation. Personally, I agree with the banning of animal testing for non-medical products, but I feel that it may be a necessary evil where new drugs and medical procedures are concerned.\n\n另一方面，可能并非总是有可靠的动物实验替代方案。支持在医学研究中使用动物的人认为，如果可以拯救人类生命，那么老鼠或大鼠所承受的某些痛苦是可以被证明的。他们争辩说，如果自己的家庭成员需要通过动物实验开发出来的医疗治疗，反对此类研究的人可能会有不同的感受。就我个人而言，我同意禁止非医疗产品的动物测试，但我觉得在新药和医疗程序方面，这可能是必要的恶。\n\nIn conclusion, it seems to me that it would be wrong to ban testing on animals for vital medical research until equally effective alternatives have been developed.\n\n总之，在我看来，在开发出同样有效的替代方案之前，禁止对动物进行至关重要的医学研究测试将是错误的。\n\n\n# Simon S206 政府是否应该支持艺术工作者\n\nSome people think that governments should give financial support to creative artists such as painters and musicians. Others believe that creative artists should be funded by alternative sources. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.\n\nPeople have different views about the funding of creative artists. While some people disagree with the idea of government support for artists, I believe that money for art projects should come from both governments and other sources.\n\n人们对资助创意艺术家持有不同的看法。虽然有些人不同意政府对艺术家提供支持，但我认为艺术项目的资金应该来自政府和其他来源。\n\nSome art projects definitely require help from the state. In the UK, there are many works of art in public spaces, such as streets or squares in city centres. In Liverpool, for example, there are several new statues and sculptures in the docks area of the city, which has been redeveloped recently. These artworks represent culture, heritage and history. They serve to educate people about the city, and act as landmarks or talking points for visitors and tourists. Governments and local councils should pay creative artists to produce this kind of art, because without their funding our cities would be much less interesting and attractive.\n\n有些艺术项目确实需要国家的帮助。在英国，公共空间中有很多艺术作品，比如市中心的街道或广场。例如，在利物浦，城市的码头区域最近经过重新开发，有几座新的雕像和雕塑。这些艺术品代表了文化、遗产和历史。它们的作用是教育人们了解这座城市，并作为游客和观光客的地标或谈资。政府和地方议会应该支付给创意艺术家费用来创作这类艺术，因为没有他们的资金支持，我们的城市将会失去很多趣味和吸引力。\n\nOn the other hand, I can understand the arguments against government funding for art. The main reason for this view is that governments have more important concerns. For example, state budgets need to be spent on education, healthcare, infrastructure and security, among other areas. These public services are vital for a country to function properly, whereas the work of creative artists, even in public places, is a luxury. Another reason for this opinion is that artists do a job like any other professional, and they should therefore earn their own money by selling their work.\n\n另一方面，我能够理解反对政府资助艺术的观点。这种观点的主要理由是政府有更重要的事情要关心。例如，国家预算需要在教育、医疗保健、基础设施和安全等领域花费。这些公共服务对于一个国家的正常运作至关重要，而创意艺术家的工作，即使是在公共场所，也是一种奢侈。另一个原因是艺术家和其他专业人士一样，他们应该通过出售自己的作品来赚取自己的收入。\n\nIn conclusion, there are good reasons why artists should rely on alternative sources of financial support, but in my opinion government help is sometimes necessary.\n\n总之，艺术家依赖其他财务支持的来源是有充分理由的，但在我看来，有时政府的援助是必要的。\n\n\n# Simon S207 青少年是否应该无偿为社区工作\n\nSome people think that all teenagers should be required to do unpaid work in their free time to help the local community. They believe this would benefit both the individual teenager and society as a whole. Do you agree or disagree?\n\nMany young people work on a volunteer basis, and this can only be beneficial for both the individual and society as a whole. However, I do not agree that we should therefore force all teenagers to do unpaid work.\n\n许多年轻人以志愿者的身份工作，这对个人和整个社会都只有好处。然而，我不同意因此就应该强迫所有青少年做无偿工作。\n\nMost young people are already under enough pressure with their studies, without being given the added responsibility of working in their spare time. School is just as demanding as a full-time job, and teachers expect their students to do homework and exam revision on top of attending lessons every day. When young people do have some free time, we should encourage them to enjoy it with their friends or to spend it doing sports and other leisure activities. They have many years of work ahead of them when they finish their studies.\n\n大多数年轻人在学习上已经承受了足够的压力，无需再增加业余时间工作的责任。学校的要求就像全职工作一样，老师们期望学生们在每天上课之外还要做作业和复习考试。当年轻人有一些空闲时间时，我们应该鼓励他们与朋友一起享受或者进行体育和其他休闲活动。他们在完成学业后还有很多年的工作时间。\n\nAt the same time, I do not believe that society has anything to gain from obliging young people to do unpaid work. In fact, I would argue that it goes against the values of a free and fair society to force a group of people to do something against their will. Doing this can only lead to resentment amongst young people, who would feel that they were being used, and parents, who would not want to be told how to raise their children. Currently, nobody is forced to volunteer, and this is surely the best system.\n\n同时，我认为社会没有任何好处可以从强迫年轻人做无偿工作中获得。实际上，我认为这违背了自由和公平社会的价值观，强迫一群人做违背自己意愿的事。这样做只会导致年轻人产生怨恨，他们会感觉自己被利用，而父母则不希望别人告诉他们如何养育子女。目前，没有人被强迫做志愿者，这无疑是最好的系统。\n\nIn conclusion, teenagers may choose to work for free and help others, but in my opinion we should not make this compulsory.\n\n总之，青少年可以选择免费工作并帮助他人，但在我看来，我们不应该将其强制化。\n\n\n# Simon S208 我们为什么需要音乐\n\nThere are many different types of music in the world today. Why do we need music? Is the traditional music of a country more important than the international music that is heard everywhere nowadays?\n\nIt is true that a rich variety of musical styles can be found around the world. Music is a vital part of all human cultures for a range of reasons, and I would argue that traditional music is more important than modern, international music.\n\n确实，世界各地可以找到丰富多样的音乐风格。音乐因多种原因成为所有人类文化的重要组成部分，我认为传统音乐比现代国际音乐更重要。\n\nMusic is something that accompanies all of us throughout our lives. As children, we are taught songs by our parents and teachers as a means of learning language, or simply as a form of enjoyment. Children delight in singing with others, and it would appear that the act of singing in a group creates a connection between participants, regardless of their age. Later in life, people’s musical preferences develop, and we come to see our favourite songs as part of our life stories. Music both expresses and arouses emotions in a way that words alone cannot. In short, it is difficult to imagine life without it.\n\n音乐是伴随我们一生的东西。作为儿童，我们通过父母和老师教唱歌来学习语言，或仅仅作为一种享受。孩子们喜欢与他人一起唱歌，集体唱歌似乎能在参与者之间，不论年龄大小，建立一种联系。随着年龄的增长，人们的音乐喜好会发展变化，我们开始将最爱的歌曲视为生活故事的一部分。音乐以文字无法达到的方式表达和激发情感。简而言之，很难想象没有音乐的生活。\n\nIn my opinion, traditional music should be valued over the international music that has become so popular. International pop music is often catchy and fun, but it is essentially a commercial product that is marketed and sold by business people. Traditional music, by contrast, expresses the culture, customs and history of a country. Traditional styles, such as ...(example)..., connect us to the past and form part of our cultural identity. It would be a real pity if pop music became so predominant that these national styles disappeared.\n\n在我看来，应该更重视传统音乐而不是已经变得如此流行的国际音乐。国际流行音乐往往朗朗上口且有趣，但本质上它是商业人士市场推广和销售的商业产品。相比之下，传统音乐表达了一个国家的文化、习俗和历史。传统风格，例如...(例子)...，将我们与过去连接起来，构成我们文化身份的一部分。如果流行音乐变得如此主导以至于这些民族风格消失，那将是一种真正的遗憾。\n\nIn conclusion, music is a necessary part of human existence, and I believe that traditional music should be given more importance than international music.\n\n总之，音乐是人类存在的必要部分，我相信传统音乐应该比国际音乐更重要。\n\n\n# Simon S209 电脑游戏是好还是坏呢\n\nSome people regard video games as harmless fun, or even as a useful educational tool. Others, however, believe that videos games are having an adverse effect on the people who play them. In your opinion, do the drawbacks of video games outweigh the benefits?\n\nMany people, and children in particular, enjoy playing computer games. While I accept that these games can sometimes have a positive effect on the user, I believe that they are more likely to have a harmful impact.\n\n许多人，特别是儿童，喜欢玩电脑游戏。虽然我接受这些游戏有时可以对用户产生积极影响，但我认为它们更可能产生有害的影响。\n\nOn the one hand, video games can be both entertaining and educational. Users, or gamers, are transported into virtual worlds which are often more exciting and engaging than real-life pastimes. From an educational perspective, these games encourage imagination and creativity, as well as concentration, logical thinking and problem solving, all of which are useful skills outside the gaming context. Furthermore, it has been shown that computer simulation games can improve users’ motor skills and help to prepare them for real-world tasks, such as flying a plane.\n\n一方面，视频游戏既有趣又具有教育意义。用户或玩家被带入通常比现实生活更激动人心和更引人入胜的虚拟世界。从教育角度来看，这些游戏鼓励想象力和创造力，以及集中注意力、逻辑思维和解决问题的能力，这些都是游戏环境外的有用技能。此外，研究表明，计算机模拟游戏可以改善用户的运动技能，并帮助他们为现实世界的任务做准备，例如飞行。\n\nHowever, I would argue that these benefits are outweighed by the drawbacks. Gaming can be highly addictive because users are constantly given scores, new targets and frequent rewards to keep them playing. Many children now spend hours each day trying to progress through the levels of a game or to get a higher score than their friends. This type of addiction can have effects ranging from lack of sleep to problems at school, when homework is sacrificed for a few more hours on the computer or console. The rise in obesity in recent years has also been linked in part to the sedentary lifestyle and lack of exercise that often accompany gaming addiction.\n\n然而，我认为这些好处被缺点所掩盖。游戏可能非常容易上瘾，因为用户不断获得分数、新目标和频繁的奖励以保持他们的游戏兴趣。现在许多儿童每天花几小时试图通过游戏的各个级别或获得比朋友更高的分数。这种上瘾可以产生从缺乏睡眠到学校问题的各种影响，当作业被牺牲以换取在电脑或游戏机上的几个小时。近年来肥胖的增加也部分与经常伴随游戏成瘾的久坐生活方式和缺乏运动有关。\n\nIn conclusion, it seems to me that the potential dangers of video games are more significant than the possible benefits.\n\n总之，我认为视频游戏的潜在危险比可能的好处更为重要。\n\n\n# Simon S210 平均寿命变长的原因和应对方法\n\nIn the developed world, average life expectancy is increasing. What problems will this cause for individuals and society? Suggest some measures that could be taken to reduce the impact of ageing populations.\n\nIt is true that people in industrialised nations can expect to live longer than ever before. Although there will undoubtedly be some negative consequences of this trend, societies can take steps to mitigate these potential problems.\n\n确实，工业化国家的人们可以预期比以往任何时候都活得更长。虽然这一趋势无疑会带来一些负面后果，但社会可以采取措施来减轻这些潜在问题。\n\nAs people live longer and the populations of developed countries grow older, several related problems can be anticipated. The main issue is that there will obviously be more people of retirement age who will be eligible to receive a pension. The proportion of younger, working adults will be smaller, and governments will therefore receive less money in taxes in relation to the size of the population. In other words, an ageing population will mean a greater tax burden for working adults. Further pressures will include a rise in the demand for healthcare, and the fact young adults will increasingly have to look after their elderly relatives.\n\n随着人们寿命延长和发达国家人口老龄化，可以预见到几个相关问题。主要问题是将明显有更多达到退休年龄并有资格领取养老金的人。年轻的工作成年人的比例将会减少，因此政府的税收相对于人口规模会减少。换句话说，人口老龄化将意味着工作成年人的税负加重。其他压力还包括对医疗保健的需求增加，以及年轻成年人将越来越需要照顾他们的老年亲戚的事实。\n\nThere are several actions that governments could take to solve the problems described above. Firstly, a simple solution would be to increase the retirement age for working adults, perhaps from 65 to 70. Nowadays, people of this age tend to be healthy enough to continue a productive working life. A second measure would be for governments to encourage immigration in order to increase the number of working adults who pay taxes. Finally, money from national budgets will need to be taken from other areas and spent on vital healthcare, accommodation and transport facilities for the rising numbers of older citizens.\n\n政府可以采取几项措施来解决上述问题。首先，一个简单的解决方案是提高工作成年人的退休年龄，可能从65岁提高到70岁。如今，这个年龄段的人往往足够健康，可以继续有效的工作生活。第二个措施是政府鼓励移民，以增加缴税的工作成年人的数量。最后，国家预算的资金将需要从其他领域调拨出来，用于为不断增加的老年公民提供必要的医疗、住宿和交通设施。\n\nIn conclusion, various measures can be taken to tackle the problems that are certain to arise as the populations of countries grow older.\n\n总之，随着国家人口老龄化，可以采取各种措施来解决必然出现的问题。\n\n\n# Simon S211 我们应该只关心自己的国家吗\n\nWe cannot help everyone in the world that needs help, so we should only be concerned with our own communities and countries. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?\n\nSome people believe that we should not help people in other countries as long as there are problems in our own society. I disagree with this view because I believe that we should try to help as many people as possible.\n\n有些人认为，只要我们自己的社会中存在问题，我们就不应该帮助其他国家的人。我不同意这种观点，因为我认为我们应该尽可能帮助更多的人。\n\nOn the one hand, I accept that it is important to help our neighbours and fellow citizens. In most communities there are people who are impoverished or disadvantaged in some way. It is possible to find homeless people, for example, in even the wealthiest of cities, and for those who are concerned about this problem, there are usually opportunities to volunteer time or give money to support these people. In the UK, people can help in a variety of ways, from donating clothing to serving free food in a soup kitchen. As the problems are on our doorstep, and there are obvious ways to help, I can understand why some people feel that we should prioritise local charity.\n\n一方面，我接受帮助我们的邻居和同胞是重要的。在大多数社区中，都有一些贫困或以某种方式处于不利地位的人。例如，在即使是最富有的城市中也能找到无家可归的人，对于那些关心这个问题的人来说，通常有机会志愿投入时间或捐款支持这些人。在英国，人们可以通过多种方式帮助他人，从捐赠衣物到在汤厨房提供免费食物。由于问题就在我们的家门口，并且有明显的帮助方式，我可以理解为什么有些人觉得我们应该优先考虑本地慈善。\n\nAt the same time, I believe that we have an obligation to help those who live beyond our national borders. In some countries the problems that people face are much more serious than those in our own communities, and it is often even easier to help. For example, when children are dying from curable diseases in African countries, governments and individuals in richer countries can save lives simply by paying for vaccines that already exist. A small donation to an international charity might have a much greater impact than helping in our local area.\n\n同时，我认为我们有义务帮助那些生活在我们国家边界之外的人。在一些国家，人们面临的问题比我们自己社区的问题要严重得多，而且帮助起来往往更容易。例如，当非洲国家的儿童因可治疗的疾病而死亡时，较富裕国家的政府和个人只需支付已有疫苗的费用就可以挽救生命。对国际慈善机构的小额捐款可能比在我们当地帮助的影响要大得多。\n\nIn conclusion, it is true that we cannot help everyone, but in my opinion national boundaries should not stop us from helping those who are in need.\n\n总之，虽然我们无法帮助所有人，但我认为国家界限不应阻止我们帮助那些有需要的人。\n\n\n# Simon S212 科技是如何影响人们的日常交流的\n\nNowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships that people make? Has this been a positive or negative development?\n\nIt is true that new technologies have had an influence on communication between people. Technology has affected relationships in various ways, and in my opinion there are both positive and negative effects.\n\n确实，新技术对人们之间的沟通产生了影响。技术以各种方式影响了人际关系，我认为这些影响既有积极的也有消极的。\n\nTechnology has had an impact on relationships in business, education and social life. Firstly, telephones and the Internet allow business people in different countries to interact without ever meeting each other. Secondly, services like Skype create new possibilities for relationships between students and teachers. For example, a student can now take video lessons with a teacher in a different city or country. Finally, many people use social networks, like Facebook, to make new friends and find people who share common interests, and they interact through their computers rather than face to face.\n\n技术对商业、教育和社交生活中的人际关系产生了影响。首先，电话和互联网使不同国家的商务人士能够进行交流，而不需要面对面会面。其次，如Skype这样的服务为学生和老师之间的关系创造了新的可能性。例如，学生现在可以通过视频与不同城市或国家的老师上课。最后，许多人使用社交网络，如Facebook，来结交新朋友和寻找有共同兴趣的人，并通过计算机而不是面对面进行交流。\n\nOn the one hand, these developments can be extremely positive. Cooperation between people in different countries was much more difficult when communication was limited to written letters or telegrams. Nowadays, interactions by email, phone or video are almost as good as face-to-face meetings, and many of us benefit from these interactions, either in work or social contexts. On the other hand, the availability of new communication technologies can also have the result of isolating people and discouraging real interaction. For example, many young people choose to make friends online rather than mixing with their peers in the real world, and these ‘virtual’ relationships are a poor substitute for real friendships.\n\n一方面，这些发展可以非常积极。当通信只限于书信或电报时，不同国家的人们之间的合作要困难得多。如今，通过电子邮件、电话或视频的互动几乎与面对面会议一样好，我们许多人都从这些互动中受益，无论是在工作还是社交环境中。另一方面，新通信技术的可用性也可能导致人们孤立和阻碍真实的互动。例如，许多年轻人选择在线交友而不是与现实世界中的同龄人混在一起，而这些“虚拟”关系是对真实友谊的糟糕替代。\n\nIn conclusion, technology has certainly revolutionised communication between people, but not all of the outcomes of this revolution have been positive.\n\n总之，技术确实彻底改变了人与人之间的沟通方式，但这场革命的结果并非全都是积极的。\n\n\n# Simon S213 兴趣爱好应该是很困难的\n\nSome people believe that hobbies need to be difficult to be enjoyable. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nSome hobbies are relatively easy, while others present more of a challenge. Personally, I believe that both types of hobby can be fun, and I therefore disagree with the statement that hobbies need to be difficult in order to be enjoyable.\n\n有些爱好相对容易，而其他爱好则更具挑战性。我个人认为，两种类型的爱好都可以很有趣，因此我不同意爱好需要具有难度才能享受的说法。\n\nOn the one hand, many people enjoy easy hobbies. One example of an activity that is easy for most people is swimming. This hobby requires very little equipment, it is simple to learn, and it is inexpensive. I remember learning to swim at my local swimming pool when I was a child, and it never felt like a demanding or challenging experience. Another hobby that I find easy and fun is photography. In my opinion, anyone can take interesting pictures without knowing too much about the technicalities of operating a camera. Despite being straightforward, taking photos is a satisfying activity.\n\n一方面，许多人喜欢简单的爱好。一个对大多数人来说容易的活动示例是游泳。这项爱好需要的设备很少，学起来简单，而且不昂贵。我记得小时候在当地的游泳池学游泳，从来没有觉得那是一种要求高或有挑战性的经历。另一个我觉得简单有趣的爱好是摄影。在我看来，任何人都可以在不太了解操作相机的技术细节的情况下拍摄有趣的照片。尽管过程直接，但摄影是一项令人满足的活动。\n\nOn the other hand, difficult hobbies can sometimes be more exciting. If an activity is more challenging, we might feel a greater sense of satisfaction when we manage to do it successfully. For example, film editing is a hobby that requires a high level of knowledge and expertise. In my case, it took me around two years before I became competent at this activity, but now I enjoy it much more than I did when I started. I believe that many hobbies give us more pleasure when we reach a higher level of performance because the results are better and the feeling of achievement is greater.\n\n另一方面，困难的爱好有时候可以更加令人兴奋。如果一项活动更具挑战性，当我们成功完成时，我们可能会感到更大的满足感。例如，电影剪辑是一项需要高水平知识和专业技能的爱好。在我自己的例子中，我花了大约两年时间才在这项活动中变得熟练，但现在我享受它的程度远超过我开始时的情况。我相信，当我们在许多爱好中达到更高的表现水平时，我们会获得更多的快乐，因为结果更好，成就感也更大。\n\nIn conclusion, simple hobbies can be fun and relaxing, but difficult hobbies can be equally pleasurable for different reasons.\n\n总之，简单的爱好可以是有趣和放松的，但困难的爱好也可以因为不同的原因带来同样的乐趣。\n\n\n# Simon S214 平等社会和个人成就之间的关系\n\nIn recent years, there has been growing interest in the relationship between equality and personal achievement. Some people believe that individuals can achieve more in egalitarian societies. Others believe that high levels of personal achievement are possible only if individuals are free to succeed or fail according to their individual merits. What is your view of the relationship between equality and personal success?\n\nIn my opinion, an egalitarian society is one in which everyone has the same rights and the same opportunities. I completely agree that people can achieve more in this kind of society.\n\n在我看来，平等主义社会是每个人都拥有相同权利和机会的社会。我完全同意在这种社会中，人们可以实现更多。\n\nEducation is an important factor with regard to personal success in life. I believe that all children should have access to free schooling, and higher education should be either free or affordable for all those who chose to pursue a university degree. In a society without free schooling or affordable higher education, only children and young adults from wealthier families would have access to the best learning opportunities, and they would therefore be better prepared for the job market. This kind of inequality would ensure the success of some but harm the prospects of others.\n\n教育是个人生活成功的重要因素。我认为所有儿童都应该有机会接受免费教育，高等教育应该对所有选择追求大学学位的人免费或者负担得起。在一个没有免费学校教育或高等教育负担得起的社会里，只有来自较富裕家庭的儿童和年轻人才能获得最好的学习机会，因此他们会为就业市场做好更充分的准备。这种不平等将确保一些人的成功，但损害其他人的前景。\n\nI would argue that equal rights and opportunities are not in conflict with people’s freedom to succeed or fail. In other words, equality does not mean that people lose their motivation to succeed, or that they are not allowed to fail. On the contrary, I believe that most people would feel more motivated to work hard and reach their potential if they thought that they lived in a fair society. Those who did not make the same effort would know that they had wasted their opportunity. Inequality, on the other hand, would be more likely to demotivate people because they would know that the odds of success were stacked in favour of those from privileged backgrounds.\n\n我认为平等的权利和机会并不与人们成功或失败的自由相冲突。换句话说，平等并不意味着人们失去了成功的动机，或者他们不被允许失败。相反，我相信如果大多数人认为他们生活在一个公平的社会中，他们会更有动力努力工作并实现他们的潜能。那些没有做出同样努力的人会知道他们浪费了机会。另一方面，不平等更有可能使人们失去动力，因为他们会知道成功的机会更倾向于那些来自有特权背景的人。\n\nIn conclusion, it seems to me that there is a positive relationship between equality and personal success.\n\n总之，在我看来，平等与个人成功之间存在正相关关系。\n\n\n# Simon S215 大学每个科目的男生女生数量应该相等\n\nUniversities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nIn my opinion, men and women should have the same educational opportunities. However, I do not agree with the idea of accepting equal proportions of each gender in every university subject.\n\n在我看来，男性和女性应该拥有相同的教育机会。然而，我不同意在每个大学科目中接受每个性别相等比例的观点。\n\nHaving the same number of men and women on all degree courses is simply unrealistic. Student numbers on any course depend on the applications that the institution receives. If a university decided to fill courses with equal numbers of males and females, it would need enough applicants of each gender. In reality, many courses are more popular with one gender than the other, and it would not be practical to aim for equal proportions. For example, nursing courses tend to attract more female applicants, and it would be difficult to fill these courses if fifty per cent of the places needed to go to males.\n\n在所有学位课程中拥有相同数量的男性和女性简直是不现实的。任何课程的学生人数都取决于该机构收到的申请。如果大学决定让男女生人数相等，它需要每个性别足够的申请者。实际上，许多课程对一种性别比另一种更受欢迎，力求性别比例平等并不切实际。例如，护理课程往往吸引更多女性申请者，如果需要50%的名额分配给男性，这些课程将难以招满。\n\nApart from the practical concerns expressed above, I also believe that it would be unfair to base admission to university courses on gender. Universities should continue to select the best candidates for each course according to their qualifications. In this way, both men and women have the same opportunities, and applicants know that they will be successful if they work hard to achieve good grades at school. If a female student is the best candidate for a place on a course, it is surely wrong to reject her in favour of a male student with lower grades or fewer qualifications.\n\n除了上述实际问题，我还认为基于性别确定大学课程的录取是不公平的。大学应该继续根据他们的资格选择每个课程的最佳候选人。通过这种方式，男性和女性拥有相同的机会，申请者知道如果他们努力在学校取得好成绩就会成功。如果一名女学生是课程名额的最佳候选人，因为性别原因拒绝她而选择成绩较低或资格较少的男学生显然是错误的。\n\nIn conclusion, the selection of university students should be based on merit, and it would be both impractical and unfair to change to a selection procedure based on gender.\n\n总之，大学学生的选拔应基于功绩，改为基于性别的选拔程序既不切实际也不公平。\n\n\n# Simon S216 博物馆的目的应该是娱乐还是教育\n\nSome people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people, while others believe that the purpose of museums is to educate.Discuss both views and give you own opinion.\n\nPeople have different views about the role and function of museums. In my opinion, museums can and should be both entertaining and educational.\n\n人们对博物馆的作用和功能有不同的看法。我认为，博物馆既可以也应该既有趣又具有教育意义。\n\nOn the one hand, it can be argued that the main role of a museum is to entertain. Museums are tourist attractions, and their aim is to exhibit a collection of interesting objects that many people will want to see. The average visitor may become bored if he or she has to read or listen to too much educational content, so museums often put more of an emphasis on enjoyment rather than learning. This type of museum is designed to be visually spectacular, and may have interactive activities or even games as part of its exhibitions.\n\n一方面，可以认为博物馆的主要角色是娱乐。博物馆是旅游景点，其目的是展示许多人想看的一系列有趣物品。如果普通访客必须阅读或听太多教育内容，可能会感到无聊，因此博物馆通常更注重享受而不是学习。这种类型的博物馆旨在视觉上壮观，并可能在展览中包含互动活动甚至游戏。\n\nOn the other hand, some people argue that museums should focus on education. The aim of any exhibition should be to teach visitors something that they did not previously know. Usually this means that the history behind the museum’s exhibits needs to be explained, and this can be done in various ways. Some museums employ professional guides to talk to their visitors, while other museums offer headsets so that visitors can listen to detailed commentary about the exhibition. In this way, museums can play an important role in teaching people about history, culture, science, and many other aspects of life.\n\n另一方面，有些人认为博物馆应该专注于教育。任何展览的目的应该是教给游客他们以前不知道的东西。这通常意味着需要解释博物馆展品背后的历史，这可以通过多种方式完成。一些博物馆雇用专业导游与游客交谈，而其他博物馆提供耳机，让游客可以听关于展览的详细解说。通过这种方式，博物馆可以在教育人们了解历史、文化、科学以及生活的许多其他方面发挥重要作用。\n\nIn conclusion, it seems to me that a good museum should be able to offer an interesting, enjoyable, and educational experience so that people can have fun and learn something at the same time.\n\n总之，我认为一个好的博物馆应该能够提供一个有趣、愉快和具有教育意义的体验，这样人们可以在玩乐的同时学到东西。\n\n\n# Simon S217 应该上大学还是应该直接找工作\n\nSome people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school. Discuss both views and give your opinion.\n\nWhen they finish school, teenagers face the dilemma of whether to get a job or continue their education. While there are some benefits to getting a job straight after school, I would argue that it is better to go to college or university.\n\n当青少年完成学业时，他们面临着是找工作还是继续深造的困境。尽管刚从学校毕业后直接找工作有一些好处，但我认为上大学或大专更好。\n\nThe option to start work straight after school is attractive for several reasons. Many young people want to start earning money as soon as possible. In this way, they can become independent, and they will be able to afford their own house or start a family. In terms of their career, young people who decide to find work, rather than continue their studies, may progress more quickly. They will have the chance to gain real experience and learn practical skills related to their chosen profession. This may lead to promotions and a successful career.\n\n直接在学校毕业后开始工作的选项因几个原因而具有吸引力。许多年轻人希望尽快开始挣钱。通过这种方式，他们可以变得独立，并将能够负担得起自己的房子或开始组建家庭。就职业而言，选择找工作而不是继续学业的年轻人可能会更快进步。他们将有机会获得真实经验并学习与所选职业相关的实用技能。这可能会带来晋升和成功的职业生涯。\n\nOn the other hand, I believe that it is more beneficial for students to continue their studies. Firstly, academic qualifications are required in many professions. For example, it is impossible to become a doctor, teacher, or lawyer without having the relevant degree. As a result, university graduates have access to more and better job opportunities, and they tend to earn higher salaries than those with fewer qualifications. Secondly, the job market is becoming increasingly competitive, and sometimes there are hundreds of applicants for one position in a company. Young people who do not have qualifications from a university or college will not be able to compete.\n\n另一方面，我认为学生继续学习更有益。首先，许多职业需要学术资格。例如，没有相关学位就不可能成为医生、教师或律师。因此，大学毕业生可以获得更多更好的工作机会，他们的薪水通常也比那些学历较低的人高。其次，就业市场竞争越来越激烈，有时一家公司的一个职位可能有数百名申请者。没有大学或学院学历的年轻人将无法竞争。\n\nFor the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that students are more likely to be successful in their careers if they continue their studies beyond school level.\n\n基于上述原因，我认为如果学生在学校层次之外继续学习，他们在职业生涯中更有可能取得成功。\n\n\n# Simon S218 政府是否应该出钱保护濒危语言\n\nSeveral languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. Some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.\n\nIt is true that some minority languages may disappear in the near future. Although it can be argued that governments could save money by allowing this to happen, I believe that these languages should be protected and preserved.\n\n确实，一些少数民族语言可能在不久的将来消失。尽管可以认为，政府通过允许这种情况发生可以节省资金，但我认为应该保护和保存这些语言。\n\nThere are several reasons why saving minority languages could be seen as a waste of money. Firstly, if a language is only spoken by a small number of people, expensive education programmes will be needed to make sure that more people learn it, and the state will have to pay for facilities, teachers, and marketing. This money might be better spent on other public services. Secondly, it would be much cheaper and more efficient for countries to have just one language. Governments could cut all kinds of costs related to communicating with each minority group.\n\n保存少数民族语言可能被视为浪费资金有几个原因。首先，如果一种语言只有少数人说，将需要昂贵的教育计划以确保更多人学习它，而国家将不得不支付设施、教师和市场营销的费用。这些钱可能更应该用于其他公共服务。其次，对于国家来说，只有一种语言会更便宜且更高效。政府可以削减与每个少数群体沟通相关的各种成本。\n\nDespite the above arguments, I believe that governments should try to preserve languages that are less widely spoken. A language is much more than simply a means of communication; it has a vital connection with the cultural identity of the people who speak it. If a language disappears, a whole way of life will disappear with it, and we will lose the rich cultural diversity that makes societies more interesting. By spending money to protect minority languages, governments can also preserve traditions, customs, and behaviours that are part of a country’s history.\n\n尽管有上述论点，我认为政府应该努力保存较少使用的语言。语言不仅仅是交流的工具；它与说这种语言的人的文化身份有着重要的联系。如果一种语言消失，一整种生活方式也会随之消失，我们将失去使社会更有趣的丰富文化多样性。通过花钱保护少数民族语言，政府还可以保存构成国家历史的传统、习俗和行为。\n\nIn conclusion, it may save money in the short term if we allow minority languages to disappear, but in the long term, this would have an extremely negative impact on our cultural heritage.\n\n总之，如果我们允许少数民族语言消失，短期内可能会节省资金，但从长远来看，这将对我们的文化遗产产生极其负面的影响。\n\n\n# Simon S219 环境污染的方式以及政府和个人能够做什么\n\nExplain some of the ways in which humans are damaging the environment. What can governments do to address these problems? What can individual people do?\n\nHumans are responsible for a variety of environmental problems, but we can also take steps to reduce the damage that we are causing to the planet. This essay will discuss environmental problems and the measures that governments and individuals can take to address these problems.\n\n人类对许多环境问题负有责任，但我们也可以采取措施减少我们对地球的破坏。本文将讨论环境问题以及政府和个人可以采取的措施。\n\nTwo of the biggest threats to the environment are air pollution and waste. Gas emissions from factories and exhaust fumes from vehicles lead to global warming, which may have a devastating effect on the planet in the future. As the human population increases, we are also producing ever greater quantities of waste, which contaminates the earth and pollutes rivers and oceans.\n\n环境面临的两大威胁是空气污染和废物。工厂的气体排放和车辆的尾气排放导致全球变暖，这可能在未来对地球产生毁灭性的影响。随着人口的增加，我们也在产生越来越多的废物，这些废物污染了土地并且污染了河流和海洋。\n\nGovernments could certainly make more effort to reduce air pollution. They could introduce laws to limit emissions from factories or to force companies to use renewable energy from solar, wind or water power. They could also impose ‘green taxes’ on drivers and airline companies. In this way, people would be encouraged to use public transport and to take fewer flights abroad, therefore reducing emissions.\n\n政府当然可以采取更多措施来减少空气污染。他们可以制定法律限制工厂排放，或强制公司使用来自太阳能、风能或水能的可再生能源。他们还可以对驾驶者和航空公司征收“绿色税”。通过这种方式，人们将被鼓励使用公共交通并减少出国航班，从而减少排放。\n\nIndividuals should also take responsibility for the impact they have on the environment. They can take public transport rather than driving, choose products with less packaging, and recycle as much as possible. Most supermarkets now provide reusable bags for shoppers as well as ‘banks’ for recycling glass, plastic, and paper in their car parks. By reusing and recycling, we can help to reduce waste.\n\n个人也应对他们对环境的影响负责。他们可以乘坐公共交通工具而不是驾车，选择包装较少的产品，并尽可能多地回收。现在大多数超市为购物者提供可重复使用的袋子，并在停车场设有回收玻璃、塑料和纸张的“回收站”。通过重复使用和回收，我们可以帮助减少废物。\n\nIn conclusion, both national governments and individuals must play their part in looking after the environment.\n\n总之，国家政府和个人都必须在照顾环境方面发挥作用。\n\n\n# Simon S220 为何幸福很难定义以及如何获得幸福\n\nHappiness is considered very important in life. Why is it difficult to define? What factors are important in achieving happiness?\n\nIt is no doubt true that the majority of people would like to be happy in their lives. While the personal nature of happiness makes it difficult to describe, there do seem to be some common needs that we all share with regard to experiencing or achieving happiness.\n\n毫无疑问，大多数人希望在他们的生活中感到快乐。虽然快乐的个人本质使得它难以描述，但似乎确实存在一些我们都共有的关于体验或实现快乐的共同需求。\n\nHappiness is difficult to define because it means something different to each individual person. Nobody can fully understand or experience another person’s feelings, and we all have our own particular passions from which we take pleasure. Some people, for example, derive a sense of satisfaction from earning money or achieving success, whereas for others, health and family are much more important. At the same time, a range of other feelings, from excitement to peacefulness, may be associated with the idea of happiness, and the same person may therefore feel happy in a variety of different ways.\n\n快乐难以定义，因为对每个人来说意味着不同的事情。没有人能完全理解或体验另一个人的感受，我们都有自己特定的激情，从中获取快乐。例如，有些人从赚钱或取得成功中获得满足感，而对其他人来说，健康和家庭更为重要。同时，从兴奋到平和的一系列其他感受可能与快乐的概念相关联，因此同一个人可能会以多种不同的方式感到快乐。\n\nAlthough it seems almost impossible to give a precise definition of happiness, most people would agree that there are some basic preconditions to achieving it. Firstly, it is hard for a person to be happy if he or she does not have a safe place to live and enough food to eat. Our basic survival needs must surely be met before we can lead a pleasant life. Secondly, the greatest joy in life is usually found in shared experiences with family and friends, and it is rare to find a person who is content to live in complete isolation. Other key factors could be individual freedom and a sense of purpose in life.\n\n尽管给快乐下一个准确的定义似乎几乎不可能，但大多数人会同意实现快乐有一些基本前提条件。首先，如果一个人没有安全的居住环境和足够的食物，他或她很难感到快乐。我们的基本生存需求必须首先得到满足，之后我们才能过上愉快的生活。其次，生活中最大的快乐通常来自与家人和朋友的共同经历，很少有人满足于完全孤立地生活。其他关键因素可能是个人自由和生活的目标感。\n\nIn conclusion, happiness is difficult to define because it is particular to each individual, but I believe that our basic needs for shelter, food and company need to be fulfilled before we can experience it.\n\n总之，快乐难以定义，因为它对每个人都是特定的，但我相信我们在体验快乐之前需要满足住所、食物和陪伴的基本需求。\n\n\n# Simon S221 你是否同意保护野生动物是浪费资源\n\nWild animals have no place in the 21st century, so protecting them is a waste of resources. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nSome people argue that it is pointless to spend money on the protection of wild animals because we humans have no need for them. I completely disagree with this point of view.\n\nIn my opinion, it is absurd to argue that wild animals have no place in the 21stcentury. I do not believe that planet Earth exists only for the benefit of humans, and there is nothing special about this particular century that means that we suddenly have the right to allow or encourage the extinction of any species. Furthermore, there is no compelling reason why we should let animals die out. We do not need to exploit or destroy every last square metre of land in order to feed or accommodate the world’s population. There is plenty of room for us to exist side by side with wild animals, and this should be our aim.\n\nI also disagree with the idea that protecting animals is a waste of resources. It is usually the protection of natural habitats that ensures the survival of wild animals, and most scientists agree that these habitats are also crucial for human survival. For example, rainforests produce oxygen, absorb carbon dioxide and stabilise the Earth’s climate. If we destroyed these areas, the costs of managing the resulting changes to our planet would far outweigh the costs of conservation. By protecting wild animals and their habitats, we maintain the natural balance of all life on Earth.\n\nIn conclusion, we have no right to decide whether or not wild animals should exist, and I believe that we should do everything we can to protect them.\n\n\n# Simon S222 严厉惩罚交通肇事能提高行驶安全吗\n\nSome people think that strict punishments for driving offences are the key to reducing traffic accidents. Others, however, believe that other measures would be more effective in improving road safety. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.\n\nPeople have differing views with regard to the question of how to make our roads safer. In my view, both punishments and a range of other measures can be used together to promote better driving habits.\n\nOn the one hand, strict punishments can certainly help to encourage people to drive more safely. Penalties for dangerous drivers can act as a deterrent, meaning that people avoid repeating the same offence. There are various types of driving penalty, such as small fines, licence suspension, driver awareness courses, and even prison sentences. The aim of these punishments is to show dangerous drivers that their actions have negative consequences. As a result, we would hope that drivers become more disciplined and alert, and that they follow the rules more carefully.\n\nOn the other hand, I believe that safe driving can be promoted in several different ways that donot punish drivers. Firstly, it is vitally important to educate people properly before they start to drive, and this could be done in schools or even as part of an extended or more difficult driving test. Secondly, more attention could be paid to safe road design. For example, signs can be used to warn people, speed bumps and road bends can be added to calm traffic, and speed cameras can help to deter people from driving too quickly. Finally, governments or local councils could reduce road accidents by investing in better public transport, which would mean that fewer people would need to travel by car.\n\nIn conclusion, while punishments can help to prevent bad driving, I believe that other road safety measures should also be introduced.\n\n\n# Simon S223 企业除了赚钱以外要承担社会责任\n\nAs well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nBusinesses have always sought to make a profit, but it is becoming increasingly common to hear people talk about the social obligations that companies have. I completely agree with the idea that businesses should do more for society than simply make money.\n\nOn the one hand, I accept that businesses must make money in order to survive in a competitive world. It seems logical that the priority of any company should be to cover its running costs, such as employees’ wages and payments for buildings and utilities. On top of these costs, companies also need to invest in improvements and innovations if they wish to remain successful. If a company is unable to pay its bills or meet the changing needs of customers, any concerns about social responsibilities become irrelevant. In other words, a company can only make a positive contribution to society if it is in good financial health.\n\nOn the other hand, companies should not be run with the sole aim of maximising profit; they have a wider role to play in society. One social obligation that owners and managers have is to treat their employees well, rather than exploiting them. For example, they could pay a “living wage” to ensure that workers have a good quality of life. I also like the idea that businesses could use a proportion of their profits to support local charities, environmental projects or education initiatives. Finally, instead of trying to minimise their tax payments by using accounting loopholes, I believe that company bosses should be happy to contribute to society through the tax system.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that companies should place as much importance on their social responsibilities as they do on their financial objectives.\n\n\n# Simon S224 政府如何让城市生活更美好\n\nMore and more people are migrating to cities in search of a better life, but city life can be extremely difficult. Explain some of the difficulties of living in a city. How can governments make urban life better for everyone?\n\nCities are often seen as places of opportunity, but there are also some major drawbacks of living in a large metropolis. In my opinion, governments could do much more to improve city life for the average inhabitant.\n\nThe main problem for anyone who hopes to migrate to a large city is that the cost of living is likely to be much higher than it is in a small town or village. Inhabitants of cities have to pay higher prices for housing, transport, and even food. Another issue is that urban areas tend to suffer from social problems such as high crime and poverty rates in comparison with rural areas. Furthermore, the air quality in cities is often poor, due to pollution from traffic, and the streets and public transport systems are usually overcrowded. As a result, city life can be unhealthy and stressful.\n\nHowever, there are various steps that governments could take to tackle these problems. Firstly, they could invest money in the building of affordable or social housing to reduce the cost of living. Secondly, politicians have the power to ban vehicles from city centres and promote the use of cleaner public transport, which would help to reduce both air pollution and traffic congestion. In London, for example, the introduction of a congestion charge for drivers has helped to curb the traffic problem. A third option would be to develop provincial towns and rural areas, by moving industry and jobs to those regions, in order to reduce the pressure on major cities.\n\nIn conclusion, governments could certainly implement a range of measures to enhance the quality of life for all city residents.\n\n\n# Simon S225 现在人们更喜欢独居了是好还是坏呢\n\nIn some countries, many more people are choosing to live alone nowadays than in the past. Do you think this is a positive or negative development?\n\nIn recent years it has become far more normal for people to live alone, particularly in large cities in the developed world. In my opinion, this trend could have both positive and negative consequences in equal measure.\n\nThe rise in one-person households can be seen as positive for both personal and broader economic reasons. On an individual level, people who choose to live alone may become more independent and self-reliant than those who live with family members. A young adult who lives alone, for example, will need to learn to cook, clean, pay bills and manage his or her budget, all of which are valuable life skills; an increase in the number of such individuals can certainly be seen as a positive development. From an economic perspective, the trend towards living alone will result in greater demand for housing. This is likely to benefit the construction industry, estate agents and a whole host of other companies that rely on homeowners to buy their products or services.\n\nHowever, the personal and economic arguments given above can be considered from the opposite angle. Firstly, rather than the positive feeling of increased independence, people who live alone may experience feelings of loneliness, isolation and worry. They miss out on the emotional support and daily conversation that family or flatmates can provide, and they must bear the weight of all household bills and responsibilities; in this sense, perhaps the trend towards living alone is a negative one. Secondly, from the financial point of view, a rise in demand for housing is likely to push up property prices and rents. While this may benefit some businesses, the general population, including those who live alone, will be faced with rising living costs.\n\nIn conclusion, the increase in one-person households will have both beneficial and detrimental effects on individuals and on the economy.\n\n\n# Simon S226 大学生应该学习自己喜欢的还是对社会有用的\n\nSome people think that all university students should study whatever they like. Others believe that they should only be allowed to study subjects that will be useful in the future, such as those related to science and technology. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.\n\nPeople have different views about how much choice students should have with regard to what they can study at university. While some argue that it would be better for students to be forced into certain key subject areas, I believe that everyone should be able to study the course of their choice.\n\nThere are various reasons why people believe that universities should only offer subjects that will be useful in the future. They may assert that university courses like medicine, engineering and information technology are more likely to be beneficial than certain art degrees. From a personal perspective, it can be argued that these courses provide more job opportunities, career progression, better salaries, and therefore an improved quality of life for students who take them. On the societal level, by forcing people to choose particular university subjects, governments can ensure that any knowledge and skill gaps in the economy are covered. Finally, a focus on technology in higher education could lead to new inventions, economic growth, and greater future prosperity.\n\nIn spite of these arguments, I believe that university students should be free to choose their preferred areas of study. In my opinion, society will benefit more if our students are passionate about what they are learning. Besides, nobody can really predict which areas of knowledge will be most useful to society in the future, and it may be that employers begin to value creative thinking skills above practical or technical skills. If this were the case, perhaps we would need more students of art, history and philosophy than of science or technology.\n\nIn conclusion, although it might seem sensible for universities to focus only on the most useful subjects, I personally prefer the current system in which people have the right to study whatever they like.\n\n\n# Simon S227 让罪犯用亲身经历告诉青少年不要犯罪\n\nSome people who have been in prison become good citizens later, and it is often argued that these are the best people to talk to teenagers about the dangers of committing a crime. To what extent do you agree or disagree? It is true that ex-prisoners can become normal, productive members of society. I completely agree with the idea that allowing such people to speak to teenagers about their experiences is the best way to discourage them from breaking the law.\n\nIn my opinion, teenagers are more likely to accept advice from someone who can speak from experience. Reformed offenders can tell young people about how they became involved in crime, the dangers of a criminal lifestyle, and what life in prison is really like. They can also dispel any ideas that teenagers may have about criminals leading glamorous lives. While adolescents are often indifferent to the guidance given by older people, I imagine that most of them would be extremely keen to hear the stories of an ex-offender. The vivid and perhaps shocking nature of these stories is likely to have a powerful impact.\n\nThe alternatives to using reformed criminals to educate teenagers about crime would be much less effective. One option would be for police officers to visit schools and talk to young people. This could be useful in terms of informing teens about what happens to lawbreakers when they are caught, but young people are often reluctant to take advice from figures of authority. A second option would be for school teachers to speak to their students about crime, but I doubt that students would see teachers as credible sources of information about this topic. Finally, educational films might be informative, but there would be no opportunity for young people to interact and ask questions.\n\nIn conclusion, I fully support the view that people who have turned their lives around after serving a prison sentence could help to deter teenagers from committing crimes.\n\n\n# Simon S228 传统思想在当代是否还有用武之地\n\nThe older generations tend to have very traditional ideas about how people should live, think and behave. However, some people believe that these ideas are not helpful in preparing younger generations for modern life. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?\n\nIt is true that many older people believe in traditional values that often seem incompatible with the needs of younger people. While I agree that some traditional ideas are outdated, I believe that others are still useful and should not be forgotten.\n\nOn the one hand, many of the ideas that elderly people have about life are becoming less relevant for younger people. In the past, for example, people were advised to learn a profession and find a secure job for life, but today’s workers expect much more variety and diversity from their careers. At the same time, the ‘rules’ around relationships are being eroded as young adults make their own choices about who and when to marry. But perhaps the greatest disparity between the generations can be seen in their attitudes towards gender roles. The traditional roles of men and women, as breadwinners and housewives, are no longer accepted as necessary or appropriate by most younger people.\n\nOn the other hand, some traditional views and values are certainly applicable to the modern world. For example, older generations attach great importance to working hard, doing one’s best, and taking pride in one’s work, and these behaviours can surely benefit young people as they enter today’s competitive job market. Other characteristics that are perhaps seen as traditional are politeness and good manners. In our globalised world, young adults can expect to come into contact with people from a huge variety of backgrounds, and it is more important than ever to treat others with respect. Finally, I believe that young people would lead happier lives if they had a more ‘old-fashioned’ sense of community and neighbourliness.\n\nIn conclusion, although the views of older people may sometimes seem unhelpful in today’s world, we should not dismiss all traditional ideas as irrelevant.",normalizedContent:"# simon s201 政府是否该支持本土电影\n\nmany people prefer to watch foreign films rather than locally produced films. why could this be? should governments give more financial support to local film industries?\n\nit is true that foreign films are more popular in many countries than domestically produced films. there could be several reasons why this is the case, and i believe that governments should promote local film-making by subsidizing the industry.\n\n确实，在许多国家，外国电影比国产电影更受欢迎。这可能是由几个原因造成的，我认为政府应该通过补贴产业来推动本地电影制作。\n\nthere are various reasons why many people find foreign films more enjoyable than the films produced in their own countries. firstly, the established film industries in certain countries have huge budgets for action, special effects and to shoot scenes in spectacular locations. hollywood blockbusters like ‘avatar’ or the james bond films are examples of such productions and the global appeal that they have. another reason why these big-budget films are so successful is that they often star the most famous actors and actresses, and they are made by the most accomplished producers and directors. the poor quality, low-budget filmmaking in many countries suffers in comparison.\n\n许多人觉得外国电影比他们自己国家制作的电影更有趣的原因有很多。首先，某些国家的成熟电影产业拥有巨额预算用于动作场面、特效以及在壮观的地点拍摄场景。像《阿凡达》或詹姆斯·邦德电影这样的好莱坞大片就是此类制作的例子，以及它们所拥有的全球吸引力。这些大预算电影之所以如此成功，另一个原因是它们经常由最著名的演员和女演员主演，并由最有成就的制片人和导演制作。相比之下，许多国家的低质量、低成本的电影制作就显得逊色了。\n\nin my view, governments should support local film industries financially. in every country, there may be talented amateur film-makers who just need to be given the opportunity to prove themselves. to compete with big-budget productions from overseas, these people need money to pay for film crews, actors and a host of other costs related to producing high-quality films. if governments did help with these costs, they would see an increase in employment in the film industry, income from film sales, and perhaps even a rise in tourist numbers. new zealand, for example, has seen an increase in tourism related to the 'lord of the rings' films, which were partly funded by government subsidies.\n\n在我看来，政府应该在财务上支持本地电影产业。在每个国家，都可能有才华横溢的业余电影制作者，他们只是需要机会来证明自己。为了与海外的大预算制作竞争，这些人需要资金来支付电影工作人员、演员以及与制作高质量电影相关的其他一系列费用。如果政府帮助承担这些费用，他们将看到电影产业的就业增加、电影销售收入增加，甚至可能会看到游客数量上升。例如，新西兰就因为部分由政府补贴的《指环王》电影而见证了旅游业的增长。\n\nin conclusion, i believe that increased financial support could help to raise the quality of locally made films and allow them to compete with the foreign productions that currently dominate the market.\n\n总之，我相信增加财务支持可以帮助提高本地制作电影的质量，并使它们能够与目前主导市场的外国制作竞争。\n\n\n# simon s202 外国游客应该比本地游客花更多钱\n\nforeign visitors should pay more than local visitors for cultural and historical attractions. to what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?\n\nit is sometimes argued that tourists from overseas should be charged more than local residents to visit important sites and monuments. i completely disagree with this idea.\n\n有时候有人认为，来自海外的游客在参观重要的景点和纪念碑时，应该比当地居民支付更多的费用。我完全不同意这个观点。\n\nthe argument in favour of higher prices for foreign tourists would be that cultural or historical attractions often depend on state subsidies to keep them going, which means that the resident population already pays money to these sites through the tax system. however, i believe this to be a very shortsighted view. foreign tourists contribute to the economy of the host country with the money they spend on a wide range of goods and services, including food, souvenirs, accommodation, and travel. the governments and inhabitants of every country should be happy to subsidise important tourist sites and encourage people from the rest of the world to visit them.\n\n支持对外国游客收取更高价格的论点是，文化或历史景点通常依赖国家补贴来维持运营，这意味着居民通过税收系统已经为这些景点支付了费用。然而，我认为这是一种非常短视的观点。外国游客通过在食品、纪念品、住宿和旅行等广泛的商品和服务上的消费为东道国的经济作出贡献。每个国家的政府和居民都应该乐于为重要的旅游景点提供补贴，并鼓励世界其他地方的人们来访。\n\nif travellers realised that they would have to pay more to visit historical and cultural attractions in a particular nation, they would perhaps decide not to go to that country on holiday. to take the uk as an example, the tourism industry and many related jobs rely on visitors coming to the country to see places like windsor castle or saint paul’s cathedral. these two sites charge the same price regardless of nationality, and this helps to promote the nation’s cultural heritage. if overseas tourists stopped coming due to higher prices, there would be a risk of insufficient funding for the maintenance of these important buildings.\n\n如果游客意识到他们必须支付更多的费用才能参观某个国家的历史和文化景点，他们可能会决定不去那个国家度假。以英国为例，旅游业及许多相关工作依赖于游客来到该国参观温莎城堡或圣保罗大教堂等地方。这两个地点无论国籍都是同一价格，这有助于推广国家的文化遗产。如果由于价格较高而导致海外游客停止来访，那么这些重要建筑的维护资金可能会不足。\n\nin conclusion, i believe that every effort should be made to attract tourists from overseas, and it would be counterproductive to make them pay more than local residents.\n\n总之，我认为应该尽一切努力吸引海外游客，让他们支付比当地居民更多的费用将是适得其反的。\n\n\n# simon s203 现代社会的人变得更独立还是更不独立\n\nsome people think that in the modern world we are more dependent on each other, while others think that people have become more independent.discuss both views and give your own opinion.\n\npeople have different views about whether we are more or less dependent on others nowadays. in my view, modern life forces us to be more independent than people were in the past.\n\n现代人对于我们现在是否比以前更依赖他人持有不同观点。在我看来，现代生活迫使我们比过去更加独立。\n\nthere are two main reasons why it could be argued that we are more dependent on each other now. firstly, life is more complex and difficult, especially because the cost of living has increased so dramatically. for example, young adults tend to rely on their parents for help when buying a house. property prices are higher than ever, and without help it would be impossible for many people to pay a deposit and a mortgage. secondly, people seem to be more ambitious nowadays, and they want a better quality of life for their families. this means that both parents usually need to work full-time, and they depend on support from grandparents and babysitters for child care.\n\n现在我们更相互依赖的主要有两个原因。首先，生活变得更加复杂和困难，特别是生活成本显著增加。例如，年轻人在购买房屋时往往依靠父母的帮助。房价比以往任何时候都高，没有帮助，许多人将无法支付定金和抵押贷款。其次，现在的人似乎更有野心，他们希望为家庭提供更好的生活质量。这意味着父母通常需要全职工作，他们依靠祖父母和保姆来帮助照顾孩子。\n\nhowever, i would agree with those who believe that people are more independent these days. in most countries, families are becoming smaller and more dispersed, which means that people cannot count on relatives as much as they used to. we also have more freedom to travel and live far away from our home towns. for example, many students choose to study abroad instead of going to their local university, and this experience makes them more independent as they learn to live alone. another factor in this growing independence is technology, which allows us to work alone and from any part of the world.\n\n然而，我同意那些认为现在的人更独立的人。在大多数国家，家庭变得更小且更分散，这意味着人们不能像以前那样依赖亲戚。我们也有更多的自由去旅行和远离家乡生活。例如，许多学生选择出国留学而不是去本地大学，这种经历使他们在学会独立生活时变得更加独立。这种日益增长的独立性的另一个因素是技术，它使我们能够独自一人并在世界任何地方工作。\n\nin conclusion, while there are some reasons to believe that people now depend on each other more, my own view is that we are more independent than ever.\n\n总之，虽然有些理由让人相信现在的人们更加相互依赖，但我个人认为我们比以往任何时候都更独立。\n\n\n# simon s204 选择工作最重要的考虑因素是薪水\n\nwhen choosing a job, the salary is the most important consideration. to what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nmany people choose their jobs based on the size of the salary offered. personally, i disagree with the idea that money is the key consideration when deciding on a career, because i believe that other factors are equally important.\n\n人们对于现代生活中我们是否比以前更依赖他人这个问题持有不同的看法。在我看来，现代生活迫使我们比过去的人更加独立。\n\non the one hand, i agree that money is necessary in order for people to meet their basic needs. for example, we all need money to pay for housing, food, bills, health care, and education. most people consider it a priority to at least earn a salary that allows them to cover these needs and have a reasonable quality of life. if people chose their jobs based on enjoyment or other non-financial factors, they might find it difficult to support themselves. artists and musicians, for instance, are known for choosing a career path that they love, but that does not always provide them with enough money to live comfortably and raise a family.\n\n有两个主要原因可以解释为什么我们现在可能更依赖彼此。首先，生活变得更加复杂和困难，尤其是因为生活成本的显著增加。例如，年轻成年人在购买房屋时往往依赖父母的帮助。房产价格比以往任何时候都高，没有帮助的话，许多人支付首付和按揭贷款是不可能的。其次，现在的人们似乎更有野心，他们希望为家庭提供更好的生活质量。这意味着父母通常需要全职工作，他们依赖祖父母和保姆来照顾孩子。\n\nnevertheless, i believe that other considerations are just as important as what we earn in our jobs. firstly, personal relationships and the atmosphere in a workplace are extremely important when choosing a job. having a good manager or friendly colleagues, for example, can make a huge difference to workers’ levels of happiness and general quality of life. secondly, many people’s feelings of job satisfaction come from their professional achievements, the skills they learn, and the position they reach, rather than the money they earn. finally, some people choose a career because they want to help others and contribute something positive to society.\n\n然而，我同意那些认为现在的人更加独立的人。在大多数国家，家庭变得更小、更分散，这意味着人们不能像以前那样依靠亲戚。我们也有更多的自由去旅行，远离家乡生活。例如，许多学生选择出国留学而不是去当地的大学，这种经历使他们学会独自生活，变得更加独立。这种日益增长的独立性的另一个因素是技术，它允许我们独自工作，从世界任何地方工作。\n\nin conclusion, while salaries certainly affect people’s choice of profession, i do not believe that money outweighs all other motivators.\n\n总之，虽然有一些理由认为现在的人更依赖彼此，但我个人认为我们比以往任何时候都更加独立。\n\n\n# simon s205动物实验是否应该禁止\n\nnowadays animal experiments are widely used to develop new medicines and to test the safety of other products. some people argue that these experiments should be banned because it is morally wrong to cause animals to suffer, while others are in favour of them because of their benefits to humanity. discuss both views and give your own opinion.\n\nit is true that medicines and other products are routinely tested on animals before they are cleared for human use. while i tend towards the viewpoint that animal testing is morally wrong, i would have to support a limited amount of animal experimentation for the development of medicines.\n\n确实，在药物和其他产品被批准用于人类之前，通常会对动物进行测试。虽然我倾向于认为动物实验在道德上是错误的，但我必须支持为了药物开发而进行的有限数量的动物实验。\n\non the one hand, there are clear ethical arguments against animal experimentation. to use a common example of this practice, laboratory mice may be given an illness so that the effectiveness of a new drug can be measured. opponents of such research argue that humans have no right to subject animals to this kind of trauma, and that the lives of all creatures should be respected. they believe that the benefits to humans do not justify the suffering caused, and that scientists should use alternative methods of research.\n\n一方面，反对动物实验有明显的伦理论点。以这一做法的一个常见例子来说，实验室的老鼠可能会被赋予一种疾病，以便可以测量新药的效果。反对此类研究的人士认为，人类无权让动物承受这种创伤，所有生物的生命都应该受到尊重。他们认为，对人类的好处并不足以证明造成的痛苦，科学家应该使用研究的其他方法。\n\non the other hand, reliable alternatives to animal experimentation may not always be available. supporters of the use of animals in medical research believe that a certain amount of suffering on the part of mice or rats can be justified if human lives are saved. they argue that opponents of such research might feel differently if a member of their own families needed a medical treatment that had been developed through the use of animal experimentation. personally, i agree with the banning of animal testing for non-medical products, but i feel that it may be a necessary evil where new drugs and medical procedures are concerned.\n\n另一方面，可能并非总是有可靠的动物实验替代方案。支持在医学研究中使用动物的人认为，如果可以拯救人类生命，那么老鼠或大鼠所承受的某些痛苦是可以被证明的。他们争辩说，如果自己的家庭成员需要通过动物实验开发出来的医疗治疗，反对此类研究的人可能会有不同的感受。就我个人而言，我同意禁止非医疗产品的动物测试，但我觉得在新药和医疗程序方面，这可能是必要的恶。\n\nin conclusion, it seems to me that it would be wrong to ban testing on animals for vital medical research until equally effective alternatives have been developed.\n\n总之，在我看来，在开发出同样有效的替代方案之前，禁止对动物进行至关重要的医学研究测试将是错误的。\n\n\n# simon s206 政府是否应该支持艺术工作者\n\nsome people think that governments should give financial support to creative artists such as painters and musicians. others believe that creative artists should be funded by alternative sources. discuss both views and give your own opinion.\n\npeople have different views about the funding of creative artists. while some people disagree with the idea of government support for artists, i believe that money for art projects should come from both governments and other sources.\n\n人们对资助创意艺术家持有不同的看法。虽然有些人不同意政府对艺术家提供支持，但我认为艺术项目的资金应该来自政府和其他来源。\n\nsome art projects definitely require help from the state. in the uk, there are many works of art in public spaces, such as streets or squares in city centres. in liverpool, for example, there are several new statues and sculptures in the docks area of the city, which has been redeveloped recently. these artworks represent culture, heritage and history. they serve to educate people about the city, and act as landmarks or talking points for visitors and tourists. governments and local councils should pay creative artists to produce this kind of art, because without their funding our cities would be much less interesting and attractive.\n\n有些艺术项目确实需要国家的帮助。在英国，公共空间中有很多艺术作品，比如市中心的街道或广场。例如，在利物浦，城市的码头区域最近经过重新开发，有几座新的雕像和雕塑。这些艺术品代表了文化、遗产和历史。它们的作用是教育人们了解这座城市，并作为游客和观光客的地标或谈资。政府和地方议会应该支付给创意艺术家费用来创作这类艺术，因为没有他们的资金支持，我们的城市将会失去很多趣味和吸引力。\n\non the other hand, i can understand the arguments against government funding for art. the main reason for this view is that governments have more important concerns. for example, state budgets need to be spent on education, healthcare, infrastructure and security, among other areas. these public services are vital for a country to function properly, whereas the work of creative artists, even in public places, is a luxury. another reason for this opinion is that artists do a job like any other professional, and they should therefore earn their own money by selling their work.\n\n另一方面，我能够理解反对政府资助艺术的观点。这种观点的主要理由是政府有更重要的事情要关心。例如，国家预算需要在教育、医疗保健、基础设施和安全等领域花费。这些公共服务对于一个国家的正常运作至关重要，而创意艺术家的工作，即使是在公共场所，也是一种奢侈。另一个原因是艺术家和其他专业人士一样，他们应该通过出售自己的作品来赚取自己的收入。\n\nin conclusion, there are good reasons why artists should rely on alternative sources of financial support, but in my opinion government help is sometimes necessary.\n\n总之，艺术家依赖其他财务支持的来源是有充分理由的，但在我看来，有时政府的援助是必要的。\n\n\n# simon s207 青少年是否应该无偿为社区工作\n\nsome people think that all teenagers should be required to do unpaid work in their free time to help the local community. they believe this would benefit both the individual teenager and society as a whole. do you agree or disagree?\n\nmany young people work on a volunteer basis, and this can only be beneficial for both the individual and society as a whole. however, i do not agree that we should therefore force all teenagers to do unpaid work.\n\n许多年轻人以志愿者的身份工作，这对个人和整个社会都只有好处。然而，我不同意因此就应该强迫所有青少年做无偿工作。\n\nmost young people are already under enough pressure with their studies, without being given the added responsibility of working in their spare time. school is just as demanding as a full-time job, and teachers expect their students to do homework and exam revision on top of attending lessons every day. when young people do have some free time, we should encourage them to enjoy it with their friends or to spend it doing sports and other leisure activities. they have many years of work ahead of them when they finish their studies.\n\n大多数年轻人在学习上已经承受了足够的压力，无需再增加业余时间工作的责任。学校的要求就像全职工作一样，老师们期望学生们在每天上课之外还要做作业和复习考试。当年轻人有一些空闲时间时，我们应该鼓励他们与朋友一起享受或者进行体育和其他休闲活动。他们在完成学业后还有很多年的工作时间。\n\nat the same time, i do not believe that society has anything to gain from obliging young people to do unpaid work. in fact, i would argue that it goes against the values of a free and fair society to force a group of people to do something against their will. doing this can only lead to resentment amongst young people, who would feel that they were being used, and parents, who would not want to be told how to raise their children. currently, nobody is forced to volunteer, and this is surely the best system.\n\n同时，我认为社会没有任何好处可以从强迫年轻人做无偿工作中获得。实际上，我认为这违背了自由和公平社会的价值观，强迫一群人做违背自己意愿的事。这样做只会导致年轻人产生怨恨，他们会感觉自己被利用，而父母则不希望别人告诉他们如何养育子女。目前，没有人被强迫做志愿者，这无疑是最好的系统。\n\nin conclusion, teenagers may choose to work for free and help others, but in my opinion we should not make this compulsory.\n\n总之，青少年可以选择免费工作并帮助他人，但在我看来，我们不应该将其强制化。\n\n\n# simon s208 我们为什么需要音乐\n\nthere are many different types of music in the world today. why do we need music? is the traditional music of a country more important than the international music that is heard everywhere nowadays?\n\nit is true that a rich variety of musical styles can be found around the world. music is a vital part of all human cultures for a range of reasons, and i would argue that traditional music is more important than modern, international music.\n\n确实，世界各地可以找到丰富多样的音乐风格。音乐因多种原因成为所有人类文化的重要组成部分，我认为传统音乐比现代国际音乐更重要。\n\nmusic is something that accompanies all of us throughout our lives. as children, we are taught songs by our parents and teachers as a means of learning language, or simply as a form of enjoyment. children delight in singing with others, and it would appear that the act of singing in a group creates a connection between participants, regardless of their age. later in life, people’s musical preferences develop, and we come to see our favourite songs as part of our life stories. music both expresses and arouses emotions in a way that words alone cannot. in short, it is difficult to imagine life without it.\n\n音乐是伴随我们一生的东西。作为儿童，我们通过父母和老师教唱歌来学习语言，或仅仅作为一种享受。孩子们喜欢与他人一起唱歌，集体唱歌似乎能在参与者之间，不论年龄大小，建立一种联系。随着年龄的增长，人们的音乐喜好会发展变化，我们开始将最爱的歌曲视为生活故事的一部分。音乐以文字无法达到的方式表达和激发情感。简而言之，很难想象没有音乐的生活。\n\nin my opinion, traditional music should be valued over the international music that has become so popular. international pop music is often catchy and fun, but it is essentially a commercial product that is marketed and sold by business people. traditional music, by contrast, expresses the culture, customs and history of a country. traditional styles, such as ...(example)..., connect us to the past and form part of our cultural identity. it would be a real pity if pop music became so predominant that these national styles disappeared.\n\n在我看来，应该更重视传统音乐而不是已经变得如此流行的国际音乐。国际流行音乐往往朗朗上口且有趣，但本质上它是商业人士市场推广和销售的商业产品。相比之下，传统音乐表达了一个国家的文化、习俗和历史。传统风格，例如...(例子)...，将我们与过去连接起来，构成我们文化身份的一部分。如果流行音乐变得如此主导以至于这些民族风格消失，那将是一种真正的遗憾。\n\nin conclusion, music is a necessary part of human existence, and i believe that traditional music should be given more importance than international music.\n\n总之，音乐是人类存在的必要部分，我相信传统音乐应该比国际音乐更重要。\n\n\n# simon s209 电脑游戏是好还是坏呢\n\nsome people regard video games as harmless fun, or even as a useful educational tool. others, however, believe that videos games are having an adverse effect on the people who play them. in your opinion, do the drawbacks of video games outweigh the benefits?\n\nmany people, and children in particular, enjoy playing computer games. while i accept that these games can sometimes have a positive effect on the user, i believe that they are more likely to have a harmful impact.\n\n许多人，特别是儿童，喜欢玩电脑游戏。虽然我接受这些游戏有时可以对用户产生积极影响，但我认为它们更可能产生有害的影响。\n\non the one hand, video games can be both entertaining and educational. users, or gamers, are transported into virtual worlds which are often more exciting and engaging than real-life pastimes. from an educational perspective, these games encourage imagination and creativity, as well as concentration, logical thinking and problem solving, all of which are useful skills outside the gaming context. furthermore, it has been shown that computer simulation games can improve users’ motor skills and help to prepare them for real-world tasks, such as flying a plane.\n\n一方面，视频游戏既有趣又具有教育意义。用户或玩家被带入通常比现实生活更激动人心和更引人入胜的虚拟世界。从教育角度来看，这些游戏鼓励想象力和创造力，以及集中注意力、逻辑思维和解决问题的能力，这些都是游戏环境外的有用技能。此外，研究表明，计算机模拟游戏可以改善用户的运动技能，并帮助他们为现实世界的任务做准备，例如飞行。\n\nhowever, i would argue that these benefits are outweighed by the drawbacks. gaming can be highly addictive because users are constantly given scores, new targets and frequent rewards to keep them playing. many children now spend hours each day trying to progress through the levels of a game or to get a higher score than their friends. this type of addiction can have effects ranging from lack of sleep to problems at school, when homework is sacrificed for a few more hours on the computer or console. the rise in obesity in recent years has also been linked in part to the sedentary lifestyle and lack of exercise that often accompany gaming addiction.\n\n然而，我认为这些好处被缺点所掩盖。游戏可能非常容易上瘾，因为用户不断获得分数、新目标和频繁的奖励以保持他们的游戏兴趣。现在许多儿童每天花几小时试图通过游戏的各个级别或获得比朋友更高的分数。这种上瘾可以产生从缺乏睡眠到学校问题的各种影响，当作业被牺牲以换取在电脑或游戏机上的几个小时。近年来肥胖的增加也部分与经常伴随游戏成瘾的久坐生活方式和缺乏运动有关。\n\nin conclusion, it seems to me that the potential dangers of video games are more significant than the possible benefits.\n\n总之，我认为视频游戏的潜在危险比可能的好处更为重要。\n\n\n# simon s210 平均寿命变长的原因和应对方法\n\nin the developed world, average life expectancy is increasing. what problems will this cause for individuals and society? suggest some measures that could be taken to reduce the impact of ageing populations.\n\nit is true that people in industrialised nations can expect to live longer than ever before. although there will undoubtedly be some negative consequences of this trend, societies can take steps to mitigate these potential problems.\n\n确实，工业化国家的人们可以预期比以往任何时候都活得更长。虽然这一趋势无疑会带来一些负面后果，但社会可以采取措施来减轻这些潜在问题。\n\nas people live longer and the populations of developed countries grow older, several related problems can be anticipated. the main issue is that there will obviously be more people of retirement age who will be eligible to receive a pension. the proportion of younger, working adults will be smaller, and governments will therefore receive less money in taxes in relation to the size of the population. in other words, an ageing population will mean a greater tax burden for working adults. further pressures will include a rise in the demand for healthcare, and the fact young adults will increasingly have to look after their elderly relatives.\n\n随着人们寿命延长和发达国家人口老龄化，可以预见到几个相关问题。主要问题是将明显有更多达到退休年龄并有资格领取养老金的人。年轻的工作成年人的比例将会减少，因此政府的税收相对于人口规模会减少。换句话说，人口老龄化将意味着工作成年人的税负加重。其他压力还包括对医疗保健的需求增加，以及年轻成年人将越来越需要照顾他们的老年亲戚的事实。\n\nthere are several actions that governments could take to solve the problems described above. firstly, a simple solution would be to increase the retirement age for working adults, perhaps from 65 to 70. nowadays, people of this age tend to be healthy enough to continue a productive working life. a second measure would be for governments to encourage immigration in order to increase the number of working adults who pay taxes. finally, money from national budgets will need to be taken from other areas and spent on vital healthcare, accommodation and transport facilities for the rising numbers of older citizens.\n\n政府可以采取几项措施来解决上述问题。首先，一个简单的解决方案是提高工作成年人的退休年龄，可能从65岁提高到70岁。如今，这个年龄段的人往往足够健康，可以继续有效的工作生活。第二个措施是政府鼓励移民，以增加缴税的工作成年人的数量。最后，国家预算的资金将需要从其他领域调拨出来，用于为不断增加的老年公民提供必要的医疗、住宿和交通设施。\n\nin conclusion, various measures can be taken to tackle the problems that are certain to arise as the populations of countries grow older.\n\n总之，随着国家人口老龄化，可以采取各种措施来解决必然出现的问题。\n\n\n# simon s211 我们应该只关心自己的国家吗\n\nwe cannot help everyone in the world that needs help, so we should only be concerned with our own communities and countries. to what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?\n\nsome people believe that we should not help people in other countries as long as there are problems in our own society. i disagree with this view because i believe that we should try to help as many people as possible.\n\n有些人认为，只要我们自己的社会中存在问题，我们就不应该帮助其他国家的人。我不同意这种观点，因为我认为我们应该尽可能帮助更多的人。\n\non the one hand, i accept that it is important to help our neighbours and fellow citizens. in most communities there are people who are impoverished or disadvantaged in some way. it is possible to find homeless people, for example, in even the wealthiest of cities, and for those who are concerned about this problem, there are usually opportunities to volunteer time or give money to support these people. in the uk, people can help in a variety of ways, from donating clothing to serving free food in a soup kitchen. as the problems are on our doorstep, and there are obvious ways to help, i can understand why some people feel that we should prioritise local charity.\n\n一方面，我接受帮助我们的邻居和同胞是重要的。在大多数社区中，都有一些贫困或以某种方式处于不利地位的人。例如，在即使是最富有的城市中也能找到无家可归的人，对于那些关心这个问题的人来说，通常有机会志愿投入时间或捐款支持这些人。在英国，人们可以通过多种方式帮助他人，从捐赠衣物到在汤厨房提供免费食物。由于问题就在我们的家门口，并且有明显的帮助方式，我可以理解为什么有些人觉得我们应该优先考虑本地慈善。\n\nat the same time, i believe that we have an obligation to help those who live beyond our national borders. in some countries the problems that people face are much more serious than those in our own communities, and it is often even easier to help. for example, when children are dying from curable diseases in african countries, governments and individuals in richer countries can save lives simply by paying for vaccines that already exist. a small donation to an international charity might have a much greater impact than helping in our local area.\n\n同时，我认为我们有义务帮助那些生活在我们国家边界之外的人。在一些国家，人们面临的问题比我们自己社区的问题要严重得多，而且帮助起来往往更容易。例如，当非洲国家的儿童因可治疗的疾病而死亡时，较富裕国家的政府和个人只需支付已有疫苗的费用就可以挽救生命。对国际慈善机构的小额捐款可能比在我们当地帮助的影响要大得多。\n\nin conclusion, it is true that we cannot help everyone, but in my opinion national boundaries should not stop us from helping those who are in need.\n\n总之，虽然我们无法帮助所有人，但我认为国家界限不应阻止我们帮助那些有需要的人。\n\n\n# simon s212 科技是如何影响人们的日常交流的\n\nnowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. in what ways has technology affected the types of relationships that people make? has this been a positive or negative development?\n\nit is true that new technologies have had an influence on communication between people. technology has affected relationships in various ways, and in my opinion there are both positive and negative effects.\n\n确实，新技术对人们之间的沟通产生了影响。技术以各种方式影响了人际关系，我认为这些影响既有积极的也有消极的。\n\ntechnology has had an impact on relationships in business, education and social life. firstly, telephones and the internet allow business people in different countries to interact without ever meeting each other. secondly, services like skype create new possibilities for relationships between students and teachers. for example, a student can now take video lessons with a teacher in a different city or country. finally, many people use social networks, like facebook, to make new friends and find people who share common interests, and they interact through their computers rather than face to face.\n\n技术对商业、教育和社交生活中的人际关系产生了影响。首先，电话和互联网使不同国家的商务人士能够进行交流，而不需要面对面会面。其次，如skype这样的服务为学生和老师之间的关系创造了新的可能性。例如，学生现在可以通过视频与不同城市或国家的老师上课。最后，许多人使用社交网络，如facebook，来结交新朋友和寻找有共同兴趣的人，并通过计算机而不是面对面进行交流。\n\non the one hand, these developments can be extremely positive. cooperation between people in different countries was much more difficult when communication was limited to written letters or telegrams. nowadays, interactions by email, phone or video are almost as good as face-to-face meetings, and many of us benefit from these interactions, either in work or social contexts. on the other hand, the availability of new communication technologies can also have the result of isolating people and discouraging real interaction. for example, many young people choose to make friends online rather than mixing with their peers in the real world, and these ‘virtual’ relationships are a poor substitute for real friendships.\n\n一方面，这些发展可以非常积极。当通信只限于书信或电报时，不同国家的人们之间的合作要困难得多。如今，通过电子邮件、电话或视频的互动几乎与面对面会议一样好，我们许多人都从这些互动中受益，无论是在工作还是社交环境中。另一方面，新通信技术的可用性也可能导致人们孤立和阻碍真实的互动。例如，许多年轻人选择在线交友而不是与现实世界中的同龄人混在一起，而这些“虚拟”关系是对真实友谊的糟糕替代。\n\nin conclusion, technology has certainly revolutionised communication between people, but not all of the outcomes of this revolution have been positive.\n\n总之，技术确实彻底改变了人与人之间的沟通方式，但这场革命的结果并非全都是积极的。\n\n\n# simon s213 兴趣爱好应该是很困难的\n\nsome people believe that hobbies need to be difficult to be enjoyable. to what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nsome hobbies are relatively easy, while others present more of a challenge. personally, i believe that both types of hobby can be fun, and i therefore disagree with the statement that hobbies need to be difficult in order to be enjoyable.\n\n有些爱好相对容易，而其他爱好则更具挑战性。我个人认为，两种类型的爱好都可以很有趣，因此我不同意爱好需要具有难度才能享受的说法。\n\non the one hand, many people enjoy easy hobbies. one example of an activity that is easy for most people is swimming. this hobby requires very little equipment, it is simple to learn, and it is inexpensive. i remember learning to swim at my local swimming pool when i was a child, and it never felt like a demanding or challenging experience. another hobby that i find easy and fun is photography. in my opinion, anyone can take interesting pictures without knowing too much about the technicalities of operating a camera. despite being straightforward, taking photos is a satisfying activity.\n\n一方面，许多人喜欢简单的爱好。一个对大多数人来说容易的活动示例是游泳。这项爱好需要的设备很少，学起来简单，而且不昂贵。我记得小时候在当地的游泳池学游泳，从来没有觉得那是一种要求高或有挑战性的经历。另一个我觉得简单有趣的爱好是摄影。在我看来，任何人都可以在不太了解操作相机的技术细节的情况下拍摄有趣的照片。尽管过程直接，但摄影是一项令人满足的活动。\n\non the other hand, difficult hobbies can sometimes be more exciting. if an activity is more challenging, we might feel a greater sense of satisfaction when we manage to do it successfully. for example, film editing is a hobby that requires a high level of knowledge and expertise. in my case, it took me around two years before i became competent at this activity, but now i enjoy it much more than i did when i started. i believe that many hobbies give us more pleasure when we reach a higher level of performance because the results are better and the feeling of achievement is greater.\n\n另一方面，困难的爱好有时候可以更加令人兴奋。如果一项活动更具挑战性，当我们成功完成时，我们可能会感到更大的满足感。例如，电影剪辑是一项需要高水平知识和专业技能的爱好。在我自己的例子中，我花了大约两年时间才在这项活动中变得熟练，但现在我享受它的程度远超过我开始时的情况。我相信，当我们在许多爱好中达到更高的表现水平时，我们会获得更多的快乐，因为结果更好，成就感也更大。\n\nin conclusion, simple hobbies can be fun and relaxing, but difficult hobbies can be equally pleasurable for different reasons.\n\n总之，简单的爱好可以是有趣和放松的，但困难的爱好也可以因为不同的原因带来同样的乐趣。\n\n\n# simon s214 平等社会和个人成就之间的关系\n\nin recent years, there has been growing interest in the relationship between equality and personal achievement. some people believe that individuals can achieve more in egalitarian societies. others believe that high levels of personal achievement are possible only if individuals are free to succeed or fail according to their individual merits. what is your view of the relationship between equality and personal success?\n\nin my opinion, an egalitarian society is one in which everyone has the same rights and the same opportunities. i completely agree that people can achieve more in this kind of society.\n\n在我看来，平等主义社会是每个人都拥有相同权利和机会的社会。我完全同意在这种社会中，人们可以实现更多。\n\neducation is an important factor with regard to personal success in life. i believe that all children should have access to free schooling, and higher education should be either free or affordable for all those who chose to pursue a university degree. in a society without free schooling or affordable higher education, only children and young adults from wealthier families would have access to the best learning opportunities, and they would therefore be better prepared for the job market. this kind of inequality would ensure the success of some but harm the prospects of others.\n\n教育是个人生活成功的重要因素。我认为所有儿童都应该有机会接受免费教育，高等教育应该对所有选择追求大学学位的人免费或者负担得起。在一个没有免费学校教育或高等教育负担得起的社会里，只有来自较富裕家庭的儿童和年轻人才能获得最好的学习机会，因此他们会为就业市场做好更充分的准备。这种不平等将确保一些人的成功，但损害其他人的前景。\n\ni would argue that equal rights and opportunities are not in conflict with people’s freedom to succeed or fail. in other words, equality does not mean that people lose their motivation to succeed, or that they are not allowed to fail. on the contrary, i believe that most people would feel more motivated to work hard and reach their potential if they thought that they lived in a fair society. those who did not make the same effort would know that they had wasted their opportunity. inequality, on the other hand, would be more likely to demotivate people because they would know that the odds of success were stacked in favour of those from privileged backgrounds.\n\n我认为平等的权利和机会并不与人们成功或失败的自由相冲突。换句话说，平等并不意味着人们失去了成功的动机，或者他们不被允许失败。相反，我相信如果大多数人认为他们生活在一个公平的社会中，他们会更有动力努力工作并实现他们的潜能。那些没有做出同样努力的人会知道他们浪费了机会。另一方面，不平等更有可能使人们失去动力，因为他们会知道成功的机会更倾向于那些来自有特权背景的人。\n\nin conclusion, it seems to me that there is a positive relationship between equality and personal success.\n\n总之，在我看来，平等与个人成功之间存在正相关关系。\n\n\n# simon s215 大学每个科目的男生女生数量应该相等\n\nuniversities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. to what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nin my opinion, men and women should have the same educational opportunities. however, i do not agree with the idea of accepting equal proportions of each gender in every university subject.\n\n在我看来，男性和女性应该拥有相同的教育机会。然而，我不同意在每个大学科目中接受每个性别相等比例的观点。\n\nhaving the same number of men and women on all degree courses is simply unrealistic. student numbers on any course depend on the applications that the institution receives. if a university decided to fill courses with equal numbers of males and females, it would need enough applicants of each gender. in reality, many courses are more popular with one gender than the other, and it would not be practical to aim for equal proportions. for example, nursing courses tend to attract more female applicants, and it would be difficult to fill these courses if fifty per cent of the places needed to go to males.\n\n在所有学位课程中拥有相同数量的男性和女性简直是不现实的。任何课程的学生人数都取决于该机构收到的申请。如果大学决定让男女生人数相等，它需要每个性别足够的申请者。实际上，许多课程对一种性别比另一种更受欢迎，力求性别比例平等并不切实际。例如，护理课程往往吸引更多女性申请者，如果需要50%的名额分配给男性，这些课程将难以招满。\n\napart from the practical concerns expressed above, i also believe that it would be unfair to base admission to university courses on gender. universities should continue to select the best candidates for each course according to their qualifications. in this way, both men and women have the same opportunities, and applicants know that they will be successful if they work hard to achieve good grades at school. if a female student is the best candidate for a place on a course, it is surely wrong to reject her in favour of a male student with lower grades or fewer qualifications.\n\n除了上述实际问题，我还认为基于性别确定大学课程的录取是不公平的。大学应该继续根据他们的资格选择每个课程的最佳候选人。通过这种方式，男性和女性拥有相同的机会，申请者知道如果他们努力在学校取得好成绩就会成功。如果一名女学生是课程名额的最佳候选人，因为性别原因拒绝她而选择成绩较低或资格较少的男学生显然是错误的。\n\nin conclusion, the selection of university students should be based on merit, and it would be both impractical and unfair to change to a selection procedure based on gender.\n\n总之，大学学生的选拔应基于功绩，改为基于性别的选拔程序既不切实际也不公平。\n\n\n# simon s216 博物馆的目的应该是娱乐还是教育\n\nsome people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people, while others believe that the purpose of museums is to educate.discuss both views and give you own opinion.\n\npeople have different views about the role and function of museums. in my opinion, museums can and should be both entertaining and educational.\n\n人们对博物馆的作用和功能有不同的看法。我认为，博物馆既可以也应该既有趣又具有教育意义。\n\non the one hand, it can be argued that the main role of a museum is to entertain. museums are tourist attractions, and their aim is to exhibit a collection of interesting objects that many people will want to see. the average visitor may become bored if he or she has to read or listen to too much educational content, so museums often put more of an emphasis on enjoyment rather than learning. this type of museum is designed to be visually spectacular, and may have interactive activities or even games as part of its exhibitions.\n\n一方面，可以认为博物馆的主要角色是娱乐。博物馆是旅游景点，其目的是展示许多人想看的一系列有趣物品。如果普通访客必须阅读或听太多教育内容，可能会感到无聊，因此博物馆通常更注重享受而不是学习。这种类型的博物馆旨在视觉上壮观，并可能在展览中包含互动活动甚至游戏。\n\non the other hand, some people argue that museums should focus on education. the aim of any exhibition should be to teach visitors something that they did not previously know. usually this means that the history behind the museum’s exhibits needs to be explained, and this can be done in various ways. some museums employ professional guides to talk to their visitors, while other museums offer headsets so that visitors can listen to detailed commentary about the exhibition. in this way, museums can play an important role in teaching people about history, culture, science, and many other aspects of life.\n\n另一方面，有些人认为博物馆应该专注于教育。任何展览的目的应该是教给游客他们以前不知道的东西。这通常意味着需要解释博物馆展品背后的历史，这可以通过多种方式完成。一些博物馆雇用专业导游与游客交谈，而其他博物馆提供耳机，让游客可以听关于展览的详细解说。通过这种方式，博物馆可以在教育人们了解历史、文化、科学以及生活的许多其他方面发挥重要作用。\n\nin conclusion, it seems to me that a good museum should be able to offer an interesting, enjoyable, and educational experience so that people can have fun and learn something at the same time.\n\n总之，我认为一个好的博物馆应该能够提供一个有趣、愉快和具有教育意义的体验，这样人们可以在玩乐的同时学到东西。\n\n\n# simon s217 应该上大学还是应该直接找工作\n\nsome people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school. discuss both views and give your opinion.\n\nwhen they finish school, teenagers face the dilemma of whether to get a job or continue their education. while there are some benefits to getting a job straight after school, i would argue that it is better to go to college or university.\n\n当青少年完成学业时，他们面临着是找工作还是继续深造的困境。尽管刚从学校毕业后直接找工作有一些好处，但我认为上大学或大专更好。\n\nthe option to start work straight after school is attractive for several reasons. many young people want to start earning money as soon as possible. in this way, they can become independent, and they will be able to afford their own house or start a family. in terms of their career, young people who decide to find work, rather than continue their studies, may progress more quickly. they will have the chance to gain real experience and learn practical skills related to their chosen profession. this may lead to promotions and a successful career.\n\n直接在学校毕业后开始工作的选项因几个原因而具有吸引力。许多年轻人希望尽快开始挣钱。通过这种方式，他们可以变得独立，并将能够负担得起自己的房子或开始组建家庭。就职业而言，选择找工作而不是继续学业的年轻人可能会更快进步。他们将有机会获得真实经验并学习与所选职业相关的实用技能。这可能会带来晋升和成功的职业生涯。\n\non the other hand, i believe that it is more beneficial for students to continue their studies. firstly, academic qualifications are required in many professions. for example, it is impossible to become a doctor, teacher, or lawyer without having the relevant degree. as a result, university graduates have access to more and better job opportunities, and they tend to earn higher salaries than those with fewer qualifications. secondly, the job market is becoming increasingly competitive, and sometimes there are hundreds of applicants for one position in a company. young people who do not have qualifications from a university or college will not be able to compete.\n\n另一方面，我认为学生继续学习更有益。首先，许多职业需要学术资格。例如，没有相关学位就不可能成为医生、教师或律师。因此，大学毕业生可以获得更多更好的工作机会，他们的薪水通常也比那些学历较低的人高。其次，就业市场竞争越来越激烈，有时一家公司的一个职位可能有数百名申请者。没有大学或学院学历的年轻人将无法竞争。\n\nfor the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that students are more likely to be successful in their careers if they continue their studies beyond school level.\n\n基于上述原因，我认为如果学生在学校层次之外继续学习，他们在职业生涯中更有可能取得成功。\n\n\n# simon s218 政府是否应该出钱保护濒危语言\n\nseveral languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money. discuss both these views and give your opinion.\n\nit is true that some minority languages may disappear in the near future. although it can be argued that governments could save money by allowing this to happen, i believe that these languages should be protected and preserved.\n\n确实，一些少数民族语言可能在不久的将来消失。尽管可以认为，政府通过允许这种情况发生可以节省资金，但我认为应该保护和保存这些语言。\n\nthere are several reasons why saving minority languages could be seen as a waste of money. firstly, if a language is only spoken by a small number of people, expensive education programmes will be needed to make sure that more people learn it, and the state will have to pay for facilities, teachers, and marketing. this money might be better spent on other public services. secondly, it would be much cheaper and more efficient for countries to have just one language. governments could cut all kinds of costs related to communicating with each minority group.\n\n保存少数民族语言可能被视为浪费资金有几个原因。首先，如果一种语言只有少数人说，将需要昂贵的教育计划以确保更多人学习它，而国家将不得不支付设施、教师和市场营销的费用。这些钱可能更应该用于其他公共服务。其次，对于国家来说，只有一种语言会更便宜且更高效。政府可以削减与每个少数群体沟通相关的各种成本。\n\ndespite the above arguments, i believe that governments should try to preserve languages that are less widely spoken. a language is much more than simply a means of communication; it has a vital connection with the cultural identity of the people who speak it. if a language disappears, a whole way of life will disappear with it, and we will lose the rich cultural diversity that makes societies more interesting. by spending money to protect minority languages, governments can also preserve traditions, customs, and behaviours that are part of a country’s history.\n\n尽管有上述论点，我认为政府应该努力保存较少使用的语言。语言不仅仅是交流的工具；它与说这种语言的人的文化身份有着重要的联系。如果一种语言消失，一整种生活方式也会随之消失，我们将失去使社会更有趣的丰富文化多样性。通过花钱保护少数民族语言，政府还可以保存构成国家历史的传统、习俗和行为。\n\nin conclusion, it may save money in the short term if we allow minority languages to disappear, but in the long term, this would have an extremely negative impact on our cultural heritage.\n\n总之，如果我们允许少数民族语言消失，短期内可能会节省资金，但从长远来看，这将对我们的文化遗产产生极其负面的影响。\n\n\n# simon s219 环境污染的方式以及政府和个人能够做什么\n\nexplain some of the ways in which humans are damaging the environment. what can governments do to address these problems? what can individual people do?\n\nhumans are responsible for a variety of environmental problems, but we can also take steps to reduce the damage that we are causing to the planet. this essay will discuss environmental problems and the measures that governments and individuals can take to address these problems.\n\n人类对许多环境问题负有责任，但我们也可以采取措施减少我们对地球的破坏。本文将讨论环境问题以及政府和个人可以采取的措施。\n\ntwo of the biggest threats to the environment are air pollution and waste. gas emissions from factories and exhaust fumes from vehicles lead to global warming, which may have a devastating effect on the planet in the future. as the human population increases, we are also producing ever greater quantities of waste, which contaminates the earth and pollutes rivers and oceans.\n\n环境面临的两大威胁是空气污染和废物。工厂的气体排放和车辆的尾气排放导致全球变暖，这可能在未来对地球产生毁灭性的影响。随着人口的增加，我们也在产生越来越多的废物，这些废物污染了土地并且污染了河流和海洋。\n\ngovernments could certainly make more effort to reduce air pollution. they could introduce laws to limit emissions from factories or to force companies to use renewable energy from solar, wind or water power. they could also impose ‘green taxes’ on drivers and airline companies. in this way, people would be encouraged to use public transport and to take fewer flights abroad, therefore reducing emissions.\n\n政府当然可以采取更多措施来减少空气污染。他们可以制定法律限制工厂排放，或强制公司使用来自太阳能、风能或水能的可再生能源。他们还可以对驾驶者和航空公司征收“绿色税”。通过这种方式，人们将被鼓励使用公共交通并减少出国航班，从而减少排放。\n\nindividuals should also take responsibility for the impact they have on the environment. they can take public transport rather than driving, choose products with less packaging, and recycle as much as possible. most supermarkets now provide reusable bags for shoppers as well as ‘banks’ for recycling glass, plastic, and paper in their car parks. by reusing and recycling, we can help to reduce waste.\n\n个人也应对他们对环境的影响负责。他们可以乘坐公共交通工具而不是驾车，选择包装较少的产品，并尽可能多地回收。现在大多数超市为购物者提供可重复使用的袋子，并在停车场设有回收玻璃、塑料和纸张的“回收站”。通过重复使用和回收，我们可以帮助减少废物。\n\nin conclusion, both national governments and individuals must play their part in looking after the environment.\n\n总之，国家政府和个人都必须在照顾环境方面发挥作用。\n\n\n# simon s220 为何幸福很难定义以及如何获得幸福\n\nhappiness is considered very important in life. why is it difficult to define? what factors are important in achieving happiness?\n\nit is no doubt true that the majority of people would like to be happy in their lives. while the personal nature of happiness makes it difficult to describe, there do seem to be some common needs that we all share with regard to experiencing or achieving happiness.\n\n毫无疑问，大多数人希望在他们的生活中感到快乐。虽然快乐的个人本质使得它难以描述，但似乎确实存在一些我们都共有的关于体验或实现快乐的共同需求。\n\nhappiness is difficult to define because it means something different to each individual person. nobody can fully understand or experience another person’s feelings, and we all have our own particular passions from which we take pleasure. some people, for example, derive a sense of satisfaction from earning money or achieving success, whereas for others, health and family are much more important. at the same time, a range of other feelings, from excitement to peacefulness, may be associated with the idea of happiness, and the same person may therefore feel happy in a variety of different ways.\n\n快乐难以定义，因为对每个人来说意味着不同的事情。没有人能完全理解或体验另一个人的感受，我们都有自己特定的激情，从中获取快乐。例如，有些人从赚钱或取得成功中获得满足感，而对其他人来说，健康和家庭更为重要。同时，从兴奋到平和的一系列其他感受可能与快乐的概念相关联，因此同一个人可能会以多种不同的方式感到快乐。\n\nalthough it seems almost impossible to give a precise definition of happiness, most people would agree that there are some basic preconditions to achieving it. firstly, it is hard for a person to be happy if he or she does not have a safe place to live and enough food to eat. our basic survival needs must surely be met before we can lead a pleasant life. secondly, the greatest joy in life is usually found in shared experiences with family and friends, and it is rare to find a person who is content to live in complete isolation. other key factors could be individual freedom and a sense of purpose in life.\n\n尽管给快乐下一个准确的定义似乎几乎不可能，但大多数人会同意实现快乐有一些基本前提条件。首先，如果一个人没有安全的居住环境和足够的食物，他或她很难感到快乐。我们的基本生存需求必须首先得到满足，之后我们才能过上愉快的生活。其次，生活中最大的快乐通常来自与家人和朋友的共同经历，很少有人满足于完全孤立地生活。其他关键因素可能是个人自由和生活的目标感。\n\nin conclusion, happiness is difficult to define because it is particular to each individual, but i believe that our basic needs for shelter, food and company need to be fulfilled before we can experience it.\n\n总之，快乐难以定义，因为它对每个人都是特定的，但我相信我们在体验快乐之前需要满足住所、食物和陪伴的基本需求。\n\n\n# simon s221 你是否同意保护野生动物是浪费资源\n\nwild animals have no place in the 21st century, so protecting them is a waste of resources. to what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nsome people argue that it is pointless to spend money on the protection of wild animals because we humans have no need for them. i completely disagree with this point of view.\n\nin my opinion, it is absurd to argue that wild animals have no place in the 21stcentury. i do not believe that planet earth exists only for the benefit of humans, and there is nothing special about this particular century that means that we suddenly have the right to allow or encourage the extinction of any species. furthermore, there is no compelling reason why we should let animals die out. we do not need to exploit or destroy every last square metre of land in order to feed or accommodate the world’s population. there is plenty of room for us to exist side by side with wild animals, and this should be our aim.\n\ni also disagree with the idea that protecting animals is a waste of resources. it is usually the protection of natural habitats that ensures the survival of wild animals, and most scientists agree that these habitats are also crucial for human survival. for example, rainforests produce oxygen, absorb carbon dioxide and stabilise the earth’s climate. if we destroyed these areas, the costs of managing the resulting changes to our planet would far outweigh the costs of conservation. by protecting wild animals and their habitats, we maintain the natural balance of all life on earth.\n\nin conclusion, we have no right to decide whether or not wild animals should exist, and i believe that we should do everything we can to protect them.\n\n\n# simon s222 严厉惩罚交通肇事能提高行驶安全吗\n\nsome people think that strict punishments for driving offences are the key to reducing traffic accidents. others, however, believe that other measures would be more effective in improving road safety. discuss both these views and give your own opinion.\n\npeople have differing views with regard to the question of how to make our roads safer. in my view, both punishments and a range of other measures can be used together to promote better driving habits.\n\non the one hand, strict punishments can certainly help to encourage people to drive more safely. penalties for dangerous drivers can act as a deterrent, meaning that people avoid repeating the same offence. there are various types of driving penalty, such as small fines, licence suspension, driver awareness courses, and even prison sentences. the aim of these punishments is to show dangerous drivers that their actions have negative consequences. as a result, we would hope that drivers become more disciplined and alert, and that they follow the rules more carefully.\n\non the other hand, i believe that safe driving can be promoted in several different ways that donot punish drivers. firstly, it is vitally important to educate people properly before they start to drive, and this could be done in schools or even as part of an extended or more difficult driving test. secondly, more attention could be paid to safe road design. for example, signs can be used to warn people, speed bumps and road bends can be added to calm traffic, and speed cameras can help to deter people from driving too quickly. finally, governments or local councils could reduce road accidents by investing in better public transport, which would mean that fewer people would need to travel by car.\n\nin conclusion, while punishments can help to prevent bad driving, i believe that other road safety measures should also be introduced.\n\n\n# simon s223 企业除了赚钱以外要承担社会责任\n\nas well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities. to what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nbusinesses have always sought to make a profit, but it is becoming increasingly common to hear people talk about the social obligations that companies have. i completely agree with the idea that businesses should do more for society than simply make money.\n\non the one hand, i accept that businesses must make money in order to survive in a competitive world. it seems logical that the priority of any company should be to cover its running costs, such as employees’ wages and payments for buildings and utilities. on top of these costs, companies also need to invest in improvements and innovations if they wish to remain successful. if a company is unable to pay its bills or meet the changing needs of customers, any concerns about social responsibilities become irrelevant. in other words, a company can only make a positive contribution to society if it is in good financial health.\n\non the other hand, companies should not be run with the sole aim of maximising profit; they have a wider role to play in society. one social obligation that owners and managers have is to treat their employees well, rather than exploiting them. for example, they could pay a “living wage” to ensure that workers have a good quality of life. i also like the idea that businesses could use a proportion of their profits to support local charities, environmental projects or education initiatives. finally, instead of trying to minimise their tax payments by using accounting loopholes, i believe that company bosses should be happy to contribute to society through the tax system.\n\nin conclusion, i believe that companies should place as much importance on their social responsibilities as they do on their financial objectives.\n\n\n# simon s224 政府如何让城市生活更美好\n\nmore and more people are migrating to cities in search of a better life, but city life can be extremely difficult. explain some of the difficulties of living in a city. how can governments make urban life better for everyone?\n\ncities are often seen as places of opportunity, but there are also some major drawbacks of living in a large metropolis. in my opinion, governments could do much more to improve city life for the average inhabitant.\n\nthe main problem for anyone who hopes to migrate to a large city is that the cost of living is likely to be much higher than it is in a small town or village. inhabitants of cities have to pay higher prices for housing, transport, and even food. another issue is that urban areas tend to suffer from social problems such as high crime and poverty rates in comparison with rural areas. furthermore, the air quality in cities is often poor, due to pollution from traffic, and the streets and public transport systems are usually overcrowded. as a result, city life can be unhealthy and stressful.\n\nhowever, there are various steps that governments could take to tackle these problems. firstly, they could invest money in the building of affordable or social housing to reduce the cost of living. secondly, politicians have the power to ban vehicles from city centres and promote the use of cleaner public transport, which would help to reduce both air pollution and traffic congestion. in london, for example, the introduction of a congestion charge for drivers has helped to curb the traffic problem. a third option would be to develop provincial towns and rural areas, by moving industry and jobs to those regions, in order to reduce the pressure on major cities.\n\nin conclusion, governments could certainly implement a range of measures to enhance the quality of life for all city residents.\n\n\n# simon s225 现在人们更喜欢独居了是好还是坏呢\n\nin some countries, many more people are choosing to live alone nowadays than in the past. do you think this is a positive or negative development?\n\nin recent years it has become far more normal for people to live alone, particularly in large cities in the developed world. in my opinion, this trend could have both positive and negative consequences in equal measure.\n\nthe rise in one-person households can be seen as positive for both personal and broader economic reasons. on an individual level, people who choose to live alone may become more independent and self-reliant than those who live with family members. a young adult who lives alone, for example, will need to learn to cook, clean, pay bills and manage his or her budget, all of which are valuable life skills; an increase in the number of such individuals can certainly be seen as a positive development. from an economic perspective, the trend towards living alone will result in greater demand for housing. this is likely to benefit the construction industry, estate agents and a whole host of other companies that rely on homeowners to buy their products or services.\n\nhowever, the personal and economic arguments given above can be considered from the opposite angle. firstly, rather than the positive feeling of increased independence, people who live alone may experience feelings of loneliness, isolation and worry. they miss out on the emotional support and daily conversation that family or flatmates can provide, and they must bear the weight of all household bills and responsibilities; in this sense, perhaps the trend towards living alone is a negative one. secondly, from the financial point of view, a rise in demand for housing is likely to push up property prices and rents. while this may benefit some businesses, the general population, including those who live alone, will be faced with rising living costs.\n\nin conclusion, the increase in one-person households will have both beneficial and detrimental effects on individuals and on the economy.\n\n\n# simon s226 大学生应该学习自己喜欢的还是对社会有用的\n\nsome people think that all university students should study whatever they like. others believe that they should only be allowed to study subjects that will be useful in the future, such as those related to science and technology. discuss both these views and give your own opinion.\n\npeople have different views about how much choice students should have with regard to what they can study at university. while some argue that it would be better for students to be forced into certain key subject areas, i believe that everyone should be able to study the course of their choice.\n\nthere are various reasons why people believe that universities should only offer subjects that will be useful in the future. they may assert that university courses like medicine, engineering and information technology are more likely to be beneficial than certain art degrees. from a personal perspective, it can be argued that these courses provide more job opportunities, career progression, better salaries, and therefore an improved quality of life for students who take them. on the societal level, by forcing people to choose particular university subjects, governments can ensure that any knowledge and skill gaps in the economy are covered. finally, a focus on technology in higher education could lead to new inventions, economic growth, and greater future prosperity.\n\nin spite of these arguments, i believe that university students should be free to choose their preferred areas of study. in my opinion, society will benefit more if our students are passionate about what they are learning. besides, nobody can really predict which areas of knowledge will be most useful to society in the future, and it may be that employers begin to value creative thinking skills above practical or technical skills. if this were the case, perhaps we would need more students of art, history and philosophy than of science or technology.\n\nin conclusion, although it might seem sensible for universities to focus only on the most useful subjects, i personally prefer the current system in which people have the right to study whatever they like.\n\n\n# simon s227 让罪犯用亲身经历告诉青少年不要犯罪\n\nsome people who have been in prison become good citizens later, and it is often argued that these are the best people to talk to teenagers about the dangers of committing a crime. to what extent do you agree or disagree? it is true that ex-prisoners can become normal, productive members of society. i completely agree with the idea that allowing such people to speak to teenagers about their experiences is the best way to discourage them from breaking the law.\n\nin my opinion, teenagers are more likely to accept advice from someone who can speak from experience. reformed offenders can tell young people about how they became involved in crime, the dangers of a criminal lifestyle, and what life in prison is really like. they can also dispel any ideas that teenagers may have about criminals leading glamorous lives. while adolescents are often indifferent to the guidance given by older people, i imagine that most of them would be extremely keen to hear the stories of an ex-offender. the vivid and perhaps shocking nature of these stories is likely to have a powerful impact.\n\nthe alternatives to using reformed criminals to educate teenagers about crime would be much less effective. one option would be for police officers to visit schools and talk to young people. this could be useful in terms of informing teens about what happens to lawbreakers when they are caught, but young people are often reluctant to take advice from figures of authority. a second option would be for school teachers to speak to their students about crime, but i doubt that students would see teachers as credible sources of information about this topic. finally, educational films might be informative, but there would be no opportunity for young people to interact and ask questions.\n\nin conclusion, i fully support the view that people who have turned their lives around after serving a prison sentence could help to deter teenagers from committing crimes.\n\n\n# simon s228 传统思想在当代是否还有用武之地\n\nthe older generations tend to have very traditional ideas about how people should live, think and behave. however, some people believe that these ideas are not helpful in preparing younger generations for modern life. to what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?\n\nit is true that many older people believe in traditional values that often seem incompatible with the needs of younger people. while i agree that some traditional ideas are outdated, i believe that others are still useful and should not be forgotten.\n\non the one hand, many of the ideas that elderly people have about life are becoming less relevant for younger people. in the past, for example, people were advised to learn a profession and find a secure job for life, but today’s workers expect much more variety and diversity from their careers. at the same time, the ‘rules’ around relationships are being eroded as young adults make their own choices about who and when to marry. but perhaps the greatest disparity between the generations can be seen in their attitudes towards gender roles. the traditional roles of men and women, as breadwinners and housewives, are no longer accepted as necessary or appropriate by most younger people.\n\non the other hand, some traditional views and values are certainly applicable to the modern world. for example, older generations attach great importance to working hard, doing one’s best, and taking pride in one’s work, and these behaviours can surely benefit young people as they enter today’s competitive job market. other characteristics that are perhaps seen as traditional are politeness and good manners. in our globalised world, young adults can expect to come into contact with people from a huge variety of backgrounds, and it is more important than ever to treat others with respect. finally, i believe that young people would lead happier lives if they had a more ‘old-fashioned’ sense of community and neighbourliness.\n\nin conclusion, although the views of older people may sometimes seem unhelpful in today’s world, we should not dismiss all traditional ideas as irrelevant.",charsets:{cjk:!0},lastUpdated:"2025/05/30

博客搭建思路\n\n基于Nodejs环境，使用其自带的npm软件管理系统（输入指令型系统），和万能的npm clone指令，克隆广大的开源静态博客开发者们开发的博客主程序，（例如：VuePress，Hexo等等）至本地\n\n> 与其说是程序，不如说是静态网站文件生成器更好理解，在运行后会根据文件夹内的文档文字配合各种图形化的代码，生成对应的图形化网站\n\n根据不同源码的说明，使用对应指令，以博客源码为基础运行，并生成静态网站所需的网站文件，并部署本地服务，生成一个本地的静态网站。\n\n> 相关资料：npm - 维基百科 Node.js - 维基百科\n> \n> 其特点是运行在本地IP中，可直接无网络访问\n\n完成初步内容编写配置后，通过Git（GitHub的项目管理软件）将生成好的网站文件上传至Github准备的仓库中，并开启Github提供的GitHub page（个人静态化网站服务），即可通过给定的网址访问（Page功能开启后默认是有访问网址给出的）\n\n\n# 操作指令\n\n很尴尬，之前辛辛苦苦搭建的博客，因为后面用的太少了，先后经历了图床Picgo代理出错（jsDelivr的CDN被墙导致）9.18号打开来，连怎么调试都忘了，比较离谱\n\n先记录下Git bash的vdoing主题的调试命令，防止忘记\n\n\n# Blog调试、部署指令\n\nnpm run deploy          #部署博客\nnpm run dev      \t\t#调试模式\n\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n\n部署模式是先生成静态文档文件，随后推送至GitHub对应仓库分支，并由GitHub完成对Page的更新\n\ndev调试模式则是部署本地网页，提供网站预览服务\n\n\n# Git常用指令\n\nGit的指令特别多且繁琐，所以专门记录几个最常用的，防止遗忘\n\n> 我的原Vuepress目前还能正常运行，但具体的工况已经不明，所以尽量按照现有的操作指令执行，以后再具体拆解，防止屎山崩盘。\n\n# 在完整的更新流程中运用的代码步骤\n\n博客目前为偶尔更新状态（马上开始长期更新）。\n\n配置有Github Action自动部署，所以仓库的结构为双分支，主分支master，副分支gh-pages。\n\n主分支存放博客程序文件，可存放文章及根据npm指令生成网站所需的静态文件。\n\n副分支存放静态网站文件\n\n因此为了防止出现网站的GitHub仓库主分支内的数据内容与本地出现差异（可能是自己编辑了然后忘了同步了），从而导致数据不同步问题，可能会引发一些不必要的麻烦。因此在更新前，需要将github仓库master分支（博客主程序）与本地的代码文件合并，根据实际情况决定是本地push上传还是云端pull拉取下载合并。\n\n> 通常是云端下载，因为GitHub action是一个很常用的在线编辑功能，该功能是直接修改GitHub仓库的代码的。而本地代码通常一修改完就会同步上传，不容易出现不同步的问题\n\n步骤一：\n\n在博客本地程序文件路径下运行Bash（可在Vscode里直接运行）\n\ngit pull #该命令用于从远程获取代码并合并本地的版本\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n> git pull其实就是 git fetch 和 git merge FETCH_HEAD 的简写，该命令有结尾可以加一些对应参数，但由于我们需要合并的是master分支且该分支为主分支，刚好是默认选项，所以可以只输入pull即可\n> \n> 参考文章：git pull 命令 | 菜鸟教程 (runoob.com)\n\n步骤二：\n\n在更新所需更新的博客内容后使用如下命令\n\ngit add .  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t#将更新内容添加至本地git管理器中\ngit commit -m \'更新内容描述\'\t\t\t#确认更新内容，并“上膛”，标注更新内容\ngit commit -am \'更新内容描述\'\t\t\t#add、commit两个步骤合并为一个步骤的代码\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n\n1\n2\n3\n\n\n> git commit -m的这个“-m”是main分支或者master分支的意思\n\n步骤三：\n\ngit push\t\t\t\t\t\t\t#将更新好后的文件上传至GitHub对应分支\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n> 一定要执行步骤二才能正确push，不然无法push成功\n> \n> 更多的Git操作，请参考Git使用心得\n\n\n# 问题发现与解决\n\n\n# 代码框行号与代码行距不同\n\n其实是因为字体问题导致，更换字体后就没问题了\n\n\n# Git分支推送历史功能\n\n更新出现异常解决办法\n\n因为很喜欢给博客添加新功能，但又很容易出现不明bug，应该充分利用Git的定档备份功能，出现问题后及时回滚\n\n显示分支提交命令，会显示出提交历史，和提交代码\n\ngit log  #退出按Q即可\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n研究git checkout和git reset的区别，以及两者在操作上的区别\n\n\n# 实战操作方法\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n# 情况一：修改提交了commit且push\n\n方法一：\n\ngit reset --hard HEAD^ #一个^代表一个版本，倒退^^两个版本，~100=回退100个版本\ngit reset --hard id #回退到指定的id码\n\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n\n> 这个方法不推荐，因为会直接覆盖掉回退前的记录。(虽然不是真的删了)\n> \n> 1 --\x3e 2 –> 3 直接变成 1 –> 2\n\n这个时候再PUSH会提示线上版本比线下版本新，所以的强制提交\n\ngit push -f #强制提交\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n方法二：\n\ngit revert commit_id #用log里的版本号完全替代掉commit_id这几个字符\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n该命令意思是撤销，但保留提交记录\n\n> 1 --\x3e 2 –> 3 变成 1 –> 2 --\x3e 3 –>4 将回退到2但以2作为主体新建新的4号commit\n> \n> 注意： 操作中commit_id应写需要被移除的版本号，而上面reset则是输入要去到的版本号\n\n输入完成后会进入和git commit --amend一样的界面，用I进入输入模式，在revert “”的冒号里输入更新的名称，输入:wq回车退出。\n\nrevert命令可以直接push，不需要担心push不上去，因为是新建的commit，不会出现线上版本比线下版本好的报错。\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n# 情况二：修改并提交了，但没有push\n\n 1. git reset --soft #撤销commit\n    \n    \n    1\n    \n    1\n    \n\n 2. git reset --mixed 撤销commit和add两个动作\n    \n    \n    1\n    \n    1\n    \n\n> 以上两个办法都不会真正删除文件，Git中依旧可以查找出并还原，方便在各个版本间穿梭\n\n查看完整提交历史\n\ngit reflog \n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n\n# 0924分支推送记录\n\n当天由于更新出了bug，需要回滚到之前的版本，出现了很多问题，最核心的问题是\n\n * 回滚后无法提交git push。\n\n * 回退版本的reset和revert指令都不好用\n\n * git commit --amend指令很难用（其实是看错了操作方法）\n\n# Git操作收获——commit --amend\n\ngit commit --amend #修改提交信息（commit更新的那个信息修改）\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n该模式下默认会显示很多行带注释的操作说明，按键盘I健即可进入编辑模式，键盘上下键确定输入位置\n\n进入编辑模式：\n\n小写i：在光标所在行位置停止不动开始写入内容\n\n大写I：在光标所在行行首开始写入内容\n\n小写a：在光标所在行当前字符后开始写入内容\n\n大写A：在光标所在行行尾开始写入内容\n\n小写o：在光标所在行下一行开始写入内容\n\n大写O：在光标所在行上一行开始写入内容\n\n退出编辑模式：\n\n:w：保存文本\n\n:q：退出编辑模式\n\n:w!：强制保存，在root用户下即使文本只读也可以强制保存\n\n:q!：强制退出，所有改动不生效\n\n:wq：保存并退出\n\n> 以上操作一定要记住，:号也是命令的一部分，退不出来是因为把冒号忘记了\n\n> 操作参考git commit --amend 以及退出 vim 编辑器_vmespmvk的博客-CSDN博客\n\n\n# 0925分之推送报错\n\n今天继续更新了一些网站样式，但由于中途好奇，用git checkout到了昨天上传出bug的那个版本，然后又checkout回去继续修改。一切修改完成后，commit成功，但push时报错如下\n\nTommyZeng@TommyLaptop MINGW64 /c/Tommy/DevProjectLocal/Blog-Vuepress (master|REBASE 2/3)\n$ git push\nfatal: You are not currently on a branch.\nTo push the history leading to the current (detached HEAD)\nstate now, use\n\n    git push origin HEAD:<name-of-remote-branch>\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\n\n究其原因，根据可查资料，显示当你在进行checkout时提供了一个commit而不是分支名称，你就进入了一种“特殊”的状态里 —— detached HEAD。\n\n可能发生的问题：\n\nGit中的HEAD指针能确定您当前的工作版本（以及放置在项目工作目录中的文件）。通常，当检出正确的分支名称时，Git会在您创建新提交时自动移动HEAD指针。您将自动进入所选分支的最新提交。\n\n当您选择通过commit哈希值进行checkout时，Git将不会为您执行此操作。结果是，当您进行更改并提交它们时，这些更改将不属于任何分支。\n\n# 解决方法\n\n问题分析：出现该错误的原因是因为checkout导致的HEAD指向了非master的仓库，导致push异常。\n\n可以先讲目前更改的commit放入一个临时分支里，然后切换至master分支，再使用命令和临时分支合并（merge）\n\n先查看下目前的commit列表\n\n43c3519 (HEAD) HEAD@{0}: commit: 新版字体优化合并分支

\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n\n# 0924分支推送记录\n\n当天由于更新出了bug，需要回滚到之前的版本，出现了很多问题，最核心的问题是\n\n * 回滚后无法提交git push。\n\n * 回退版本的reset和revert指令都不好用\n\n * git commit --amend指令很难用（其实是看错了操作方法）\n\n# git操作收获——commit --amend\n\ngit commit --amend #修改提交信息（commit更新的那个信息修改）\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n该模式下默认会显示很多行带注释的操作说明，按键盘i健即可进入编辑模式，键盘上下键确定输入位置\n\n进入编辑模式：\n\n小写i：在光标所在行位置停止不动开始写入内容\n\n大写i：在光标所在行行首开始写入内容\n\n小写a：在光标所在行当前字符后开始写入内容\n\n大写a：在光标所在行行尾开始写入内容\n\n小写o：在光标所在行下一行开始写入内容\n\n大写o：在光标所在行上一行开始写入内容\n\n退出编辑模式：\n\n:w：保存文本\n\n:q：退出编辑模式\n\n:w!：强制保存，在root用户下即使文本只读也可以强制保存\n\n:q!：强制退出，所有改动不生效\n\n:wq：保存并退出\n\n> 以上操作一定要记住，:号也是命令的一部分，退不出来是因为把冒号忘记了\n\n> 操作参考git commit --amend 以及退出 vim 编辑器_vmespmvk的博客-csdn博客\n\n\n# 0925分之推送报错\n\n今天继续更新了一些网站样式，但由于中途好奇，用git checkout到了昨天上传出bug的那个版本，然后又checkout回去继续修改。一切修改完成后，commit成功，但push时报错如下\n\ntommyzeng@tommylaptop mingw64 /c/tommy/devprojectlocal/blog-vuepress (master|rebase 2/3)\n$ git push\nfatal: you are not

head。\n\n可能发生的问题：\n\ngit中的head指针能确定您当前的工作版本（以及放置在项目工作目录中的文件）。通常，当检出正确的分支名称时，git会在您创建新提交时自动移动head指针。您将自动进入所选分支的最新提交。\n\n当您选择通过commit哈希值进行checkout时，git将不会为您执行此操作。结果是，当您进行更改并提交它们时，这些更改将不属于任何分支。\n\n# 解决方法\n\n问题分析：出现该错误的原因是因为checkout导致的head指向了非master的仓库，导致push异常。\n\n可以先讲目前更改的commit放入一个临时分支里，然后切换至master分支，再使用命令和临时分支合并（merge）\n\n先查看下目前的commit列表\n\n43c3519 (head) head@{0}: commit: 新版字体优化合并分支

2023.01.29更新：更新了具体的操作案例和整理更完善的git命令大全，大家可以直接翻到最后的案例，结合实操案例，会好理解很多。\n\n\n\n# 小介绍\n\n这是一个想混迹Github不可缺少的重要工具，是Github仓库的版本控制工具。不过相信大多数人和我一样，最早接触时估计都给整的够呛，今天就专门介绍些简单的操作，方便大家初上手。\n\n\n\n# 难度: 二星\n\n这个工具最开始接触的时候可能不好理解，觉得用不明白，但其实内核极其强大，是一个极其离谱的版本管理工具。缺点就是上手较难，代码化操作时间久了经常忘记，但功能真的很强大，不得不学习，大家可以尝试我分享的实操案例，体验无限版本的代码回退。然后就可以赞叹这夸张的信息保存能力(关键是还不占空间)。\n\n\n注意\n\n想执行以下所有内容, 必须先把Git配置好, 所有操作都是基于Git的\n\n可能有些小伙伴新入坑还没搞懂，这里再次提醒一下 GitHub是开源代码托管(存放、管理)平台 Git是进行开源软件的版本管理的(用人话说就是专用的文件上传下载工具)\n\n安装教程我贴在这里, 有需要的小伙伴自取 Git - Downloading Package (git-scm.com) Windows系统Git安装教程（详解Git安装过程） - 学为所用 - 博客园 (cnblogs.com)\n\n以下操作将重点介绍两个最常见的用途:\n\n * 情景一: 把网上已经建立且运营中的仓库克隆(下载)至本地\n * 情景二: 本地自己创建的项目, 想把文件共享出来供别人学(bai)习(piao),所以需要把本地文件上传上去\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# 第一部分：基础操作介绍\n\n场景：克隆Github上的仓库内容并进行基本的文件操作(读、写、修改等)\n\n先讲讲克隆的效果, 执行完git的命令后, 会下载仓库内容至本地，并存放在一个与仓库同名的文件夹内, 并可进行更多操作\n\n提示\n\n如果仓库叫TommyZeng/picgo, 文件夹名字就会叫picgo\n\n> 建议找一个文件比较多的仓库fork(转存)到自己的GitHub中, 来练习基础的增删查改\n\n\n# 1. 首先是执行克隆指令\n\n警告\n\n注意仓库链接在这里\n\ngit clone + "仓库链接"\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n# 2. 执行初始化指令, 生成与仓库的通讯链接\n\n注意\n\n这个步骤在已经建好GitHub仓库的情况下并没有必要, 是在GitHub上没有建仓时让用户可直接在本地建仓的一种办法\n\ngit init  #仓库初始化\n\n\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n\n会生成一个.git的隐藏文件，内部有包含与仓库通讯的文件, 要填写相关user信息, 可使用代码\n\ngit config --global user.name "xxx" #就是仓库名称斜杠前的id   配置用户名\ngit config --global user.email "xxx@xxx.com"              # 配置邮件\n\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n\n\n# 3. 增删查改的方法\n\n通常完成上一步后, 就会下载到相当多的文件夹\n\n删除文件的方法：\n\n> 大多数文档里的方法是用下面这个代码一个个删除，说实话动的文件多了NM就离谱\n\ngit rm "文件名"\t        #删除文件\ngit rm -r "文件夹名字"  #删除文件夹\n\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n\n\n# 批量删除/新建文件后同步至仓库\n\n我们主要讲怎么批量删除/新建文件\n\n步骤\n\n第一步: 直接资源管理器(我的电脑)里删掉想要删除的文件, 或直接新建想要的文件 然后在git bash里输入git add .(注意.与add之间空一格)把改动添加到缓存 然后用git commit -m "clear"一次性全部删除\n\n> "引号里不一定要写clear, 任意字母都可以,但切记不能空着"\n\n这是不是就不用一个个文件commit确认，特省事情\n\n\n\n# 推送上传至仓库\n\n提示\n\n文件修改完后,用git push即可推送本地仓库至远程仓库即可\n\n注意\n\n网上有说第一次推送仓库的时候好像得用这行代码的, 2022/04/02测试了几个仓库,都不用执行这步,可忽略\n\ngit push -u origin main #第一次推送main分支时使用-u指令\ngit push origin main\n\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n做到这一步会不会对这个图理解更深了?\n\nworkspace: 本地工作区 staging area: 缓存区/暂存区 local repository: 本地仓库 remote repository: 远程仓库\n\n用一张图来表达就是\n\n\n# 4.下载仓库内容至本地\n\n警告\n\n下载仓库内容到本地使用代码\n\ngit pull origin main # 获取远程分支main并合并到当前分支\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n> 注意一定时main分支, GitHub在2020年把主分支从默认的main改成了main\n\n完成后即可按上面的增删步骤管理仓库内容\n\n\n# 避坑\n\n网上很多帖子会查出各种命令如\n\ngit add -A . #这个实测没啥用" ."就可以了\n\n递归删除法(删除全部文件)\ngit rm xxx                                                # 删除index中的文件\ngit rm -r *   # 递归删除文件(可全删)      \n\ngit commit -m \'add more files\'一次提交所有文件\n\ngit status \t#告知你文件情况\ngit commit -m \'first commit\'\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\n\n这些命令基本都能用, 不过有些杂乱,且让人晕头转向, 不用太在意这些\n\n\n\n\n\n# 第二部分：Git连接Github\n\n两者通信依赖SSH或者HTTP进行连接，SSH是电脑长期连接拉去数据时最方便的方案，操作流程如下：\n\n\n# 一、 生成 SSH 密钥\n\n# 1. 打开终端\n\n * 在 Mac 或 Linux 上，你可以直接打开 Terminal 应用程序。\n * 在 Windows 上，你可以使用 PowerShell 或者如果安装了 Git，可以使用 Git Bash。\n\n# 2. 运行 SSH 密钥生成命令\n\n * 在终端中，输入以下命令来生成一个新的 SSH 密钥：\n   \n   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"\n   \n   \n   1\n   \n   1\n   \n   * ssh-keygen 是用于生成 SSH 密钥的命令。\n   * -t rsa 指定密钥类型为 RSA，这是一种常用的密钥算法。\n   * -b 4096 指定密钥长度为 4096 位，这比默认的 2048 位更安全。\n   * -C 后面跟的是一个注释，通常是你的邮箱地址，用于帮助你识别这个密钥。这个邮箱应该是你的 GitHub 注册邮箱。\n\n# 3. 指定密钥保存位置\n\n * 当运行上述命令后，系统会询问你保存密钥的位置。如果你接受默认位置（通常是 ~/.ssh/id_rsa），直接按回车即可。如果你已经有了一个 SSH 密钥，系统会提示你是否要覆盖它。如果不想覆盖，可以输入一个新的文件名。\n\n# 4. 设置密钥密码\n\n * 接下来，系统会提示你输入一个密码（passphrase）。这是一个可选步骤，但为了增加安全性，建议设置一个密码。\n * 这个密码每次使用这个密钥时都会被要求输入，可以防止未经授权的用户使用你的密钥。\n * 输入密码后，系统会要求你再次确认。\n\n完成这些步骤后，你的新电脑上就会生成一个新的 SSH 密钥对。接下来，你需要将生成的公钥（.pub 文件）添加到你的 GitHub 账户中，这样 GitHub 就可以识别并信任从你的新电脑发出的 SSH 连接请求了。\n\n> 在 SSH 密钥生成过程中，当系统提示你输入密钥密码（passphrase）时，你可能注意到在输入时看不到任何反馈（例如星号或点），这是正常的。SSH 密钥生成工具为了安全考虑，不会在终端显示密码字符。即使你看不到输入的内容，你的输入是有效的。以下是这一步骤的详细说明：\n> \n> \n> # 输入 SSH 密钥密码\n> \n>  1. 输入密码时无可视反馈：\n>     \n>     * 当系统提示你输入密码时，即使你在键盘上输入，终端也不会显示任何字符。这是为了防止旁观者看到密码长度或模式。\n>     * 正常输入你的密码即可，即使看不到任何字符变化。\n> \n>  2. 确认密码：\n>     \n>     * 输入完密码后，按下回车键。然后，系统会要求你再次输入密码以进行确认。\n>     * 同样，在输入确认密码时，你也不会在终端看到任何可视反馈。\n>     * 再次输入相同的密码，并按回车键。\n> \n>  3. 完成密钥生成：\n>     \n>     * 如果两次输入的密码相同，系统就会生成 SSH 密钥，并保存到指定的文件中。\n>     * 你会看到一条消息，确认你的公钥和私钥的保存位置，以及一个随机生成的图案，表示你的密钥的指纹。\n> \n> \n> # 后续步骤\n> \n>  * 检查密钥：完成密钥生成后，你可以在指定的目录（通常是 ~/.ssh）下找到两个文件：一个是私钥（例如 id_rsa），另一个是公钥（例如 id_rsa.pub）。\n>  * 添加公钥到 GitHub：将公钥（.pub 文件的内容）添加到你的 GitHub 账户中，以便 GitHub 可以识别你的新设备。\n> \n> 记住，私钥是非常敏感的，必须保持安全，不要分享或发送给任何人。公钥是可以安全分享的部分，用于在服务如 GitHub 上进行身份验证。\n\n\n\n# 二、复制 SSH 公钥\n\n首先，你需要复制你刚生成的 SSH 公钥（.pub 文件）的内容。假设你使用的是默认的文件名和位置，你的公钥文件将是 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub。你可以使用下面的命令来快速复制公钥内容到剪贴板：\n\n * 在 macOS 或 Linux 上：\n   \n   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | pbcopy\n   \n   \n   1\n   \n   1\n   \n   \n   （如果 pbcopy 不可用，你可以手动打开该文件并复制内容）\n\n * 在 Windows 上使用 Git Bash：\n   \n   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | clip\n   \n   \n   1\n   \n   1\n   \n   \n\n\n# 三、添加 SSH 公钥到 GitHub\n\n然后，将复制的公钥添加到你的 GitHub 账户：\n\n 1. 登录到你的 GitHub 账户。\n 2. 打开设置：点击右上角的头像，然后选择“Settings”（设置）。\n 3. 添加 SSH 密钥：\n    * 在设置页面的侧边栏中，点击“SSH and GPG keys”。\n    * 点击“New SSH key”或“Add SSH key”按钮。\n    * 在“Title”字段中，给你的密钥一个容易识别的名称。这个名称是为了帮助你以后记住这个密钥是用在哪台电脑上的。\n    * 在“Key”字段中，粘贴你之前复制的公钥。\n    * 点击“Add SSH key”来保存新的密钥。\n\n\n\n# 四、 测试 SSH 连接\n\n完成公钥添加后，测试一下是否能够通过 SSH 连接到 GitHub：\n\n * 打开终端或 Git Bash。\n * 输入以下命令：\n   \n   ssh -T git@github.com\n   \n   \n   1\n   \n   1\n   \n * 如果是第一次连接 GitHub，可能会看到一个关于服务器身份的警告。输入 yes 继续。\n * 如果一切设置正确，你将看到一条欢迎信息，如：“Hi [username]! You\'ve successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.”\n\n这个欢迎信息表示 SSH 设置正确，并且你已经成功地通过 SSH 连接到了 GitHub。\n\n\n\n# 五、开始使用 SSH 进行 Git 操作\n\n一旦 SSH 设置完成，你就可以开始使用 SSH 进行 Git 操作了，例如克隆、推送或拉取仓库。使用 SSH URL 而不是 HTTPS URL 来克隆或操作你的仓库。\n\n例如，克隆仓库的命令将类似于：\n\ngit clone git@github.com:username/repo.git\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n这些步骤确保了你可以安全地通过 SSH 与你的 GitHub 仓库交互。\n\n\n\n# 常见问题解决\n\n# 无法连接服务的解决方法\n\n这部分如果是长期连接会用到SSH，这里有个坑是git的代理设置不对导致没有走上网的端口导致连不上，对应的报错代码如下：\n\nFailed to connect to github.com port 443 after 21111 ms: Couldn\'t connect to server\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n如出现类似问题，可以试着用以下的代码，大概率可以解决。\n\ngit config --global http.proxy http://127.0.0.1:7890\ngit config --global https.proxy http://127.0.0.1:7890\n\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#

checkout到了昨天上传出bug的那个版本，然后又checkout回去继续修改。一切修改完成后，commit成功，但push时报错如下\n\nTommyZeng@TommyLaptop MINGW64 /c/Tommy/DevProjectLocal/Blog-Vuepress (master|REBASE 2/3)\n$ git push\nfatal: You are not

解决方法\n\n问题分析：出现该错误的原因是因为checkout导致的HEAD指向了非master的仓库，导致push异常。\n\n可以先讲目前更改的commit放入一个临时分支里，然后切换至master分支，再使用命令和临时分支合并（merge）\n\n先查看下目前的commit列表\n\n43c3519 (HEAD) HEAD@{0}: commit: 新版字体优化合并分支

2023.01.29更新：更新了具体的操作案例和整理更完善的git命令大全，大家可以直接翻到最后的案例，结合实操案例，会好理解很多。\n\n\n\n# 小介绍\n\n这是一个想混迹github不可缺少的重要工具，是github仓库的版本控制工具。不过相信大多数人和我一样，最早接触时估计都给整的够呛，今天就专门介绍些简单的操作，方便大家初上手。\n\n\n\n# 难度: 二星\n\n这个工具最开始接触的时候可能不好理解，觉得用不明白，但其实内核极其强大，是一个极其离谱的版本管理工具。缺点就是上手较难，代码化操作时间久了经常忘记，但功能真的很强大，不得不学习，大家可以尝试我分享的实操案例，体验无限版本的代码回退。然后就可以赞叹这夸张的信息保存能力(关键是还不占空间)。\n\n\n注意\n\n想执行以下所有内容, 必须先把git配置好, 所有操作都是基于git的\n\n可能有些小伙伴新入坑还没搞懂，这里再次提醒一下 github是开源代码托管(存放、管理)平台 git是进行开源软件的版本管理的(用人话说就是专用的文件上传下载工具)\n\n安装教程我贴在这里, 有需要的小伙伴自取 git - downloading package (git-scm.com) windows系统git安装教程（详解git安装过程） - 学为所用 - 博客园 (cnblogs.com)\n\n以下操作将重点介绍两个最常见的用途:\n\n * 情景一: 把网上已经建立且运营中的仓库克隆(下载)至本地\n * 情景二: 本地自己创建的项目, 想把文件共享出来供别人学(bai)习(piao),所以需要把本地文件上传上去\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# 第一部分：基础操作介绍\n\n场景：克隆github上的仓库内容并进行基本的文件操作(读、写、修改等)\n\n先讲讲克隆的效果, 执行完git的命令后, 会下载仓库内容至本地，并存放在一个与仓库同名的文件夹内, 并可进行更多操作\n\n提示\n\n如果仓库叫tommyzeng/picgo, 文件夹名字就会叫picgo\n\n> 建议找一个文件比较多的仓库fork(转存)到自己的github中, 来练习基础的增删查改\n\n\n# 1. 首先是执行克隆指令\n\n警告\n\n注意仓库链接在这里\n\ngit clone + "仓库链接"\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n# 2. 执行初始化指令, 生成与仓库的通讯链接\n\n注意\n\n这个步骤在已经建好github仓库的情况下并没有必要, 是在github上没有建仓时让用户可直接在本地建仓的一种办法\n\ngit init  #仓库初始化\n\n\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n\n会生成一个.git的隐藏文件，内部有包含与仓库通讯的文件, 要填写相关user信息, 可使用代码\n\ngit config --global user.name "xxx" #就是仓库名称斜杠前的id   配置用户名\ngit config --global user.email "xxx@xxx.com"              # 配置邮件\n\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n\n\n# 3. 增删查改的方法\n\n通常完成上一步后, 就会下载到相当多的文件夹\n\n删除文件的方法：\n\n> 大多数文档里的方法是用下面这个代码一个个删除，说实话动的文件多了nm就离谱\n\ngit rm "文件名"\t        #删除文件\ngit rm -r "文件夹名字"  #删除文件夹\n\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n\n\n# 批量删除/新建文件后同步至仓库\n\n我们主要讲怎么批量删除/新建文件\n\n步骤\n\n第一步: 直接资源管理器(我的电脑)里删掉想要删除的文件, 或直接新建想要的文件 然后在git bash里输入git add .(注意.与add之间空一格)把改动添加到缓存 然后用git commit -m "clear"一次性全部删除\n\n> "引号里不一定要写clear, 任意字母都可以,但切记不能空着"\n\n这是不是就不用一个个文件commit确认，特省事情\n\n\n\n# 推送上传至仓库\n\n提示\n\n文件修改完后,用git push即可推送本地仓库至远程仓库即可\n\n注意\n\n网上有说第一次推送仓库的时候好像得用这行代码的, 2022/04/02测试了几个仓库,都不用执行这步,可忽略\n\ngit push -u origin main #第一次推送main分支时使用-u指令\ngit push origin main\n\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n做到这一步会不会对这个图理解更深了?\n\nworkspace: 本地工作区 staging area: 缓存区/暂存区 local repository: 本地仓库 remote repository: 远程仓库\n\n用一张图来表达就是\n\n\n# 4.下载仓库内容至本地\n\n警告\n\n下载仓库内容到本地使用代码\n\ngit pull origin main # 获取远程分支main并合并到当前分支\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n> 注意一定时main分支, github在2020年把主分支从默认的main改成了main\n\n完成后即可按上面的增删步骤管理仓库内容\n\n\n# 避坑\n\n网上很多帖子会查出各种命令如\n\ngit add -a . #这个实测没啥用" ."就可以了\n\n递归删除法(删除全部文件)\ngit rm xxx                                                # 删除index中的文件\ngit rm -r *   # 递归删除文件(可全删)      \n\ngit commit -m \'add more files\'一次提交所有文件\n\ngit status \t#告知你文件情况\ngit commit -m \'first commit\'\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\n\n这些命令基本都能用, 不过有些杂乱,且让人晕头转向, 不用太在意这些\n\n\n\n\n\n# 第二部分：git连接github\n\n两者通信依赖ssh或者http进行连接，ssh是电脑长期连接拉去数据时最方便的方案，操作流程如下：\n\n\n# 一、 生成 ssh 密钥\n\n# 1. 打开终端\n\n * 在 mac 或 linux 上，你可以直接打开 terminal 应用程序。\n * 在 windows 上，你可以使用 powershell 或者如果安装了 git，可以使用 git bash。\n\n# 2. 运行 ssh 密钥生成命令\n\n * 在终端中，输入以下命令来生成一个新的 ssh 密钥：\n   \n   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -c "your_email@example.com"\n   \n   \n   1\n   \n   1\n   \n   * ssh-keygen 是用于生成 ssh 密钥的命令。\n   * -t rsa 指定密钥类型为 rsa，这是一种常用的密钥算法。\n   * -b 4096 指定密钥长度为 4096 位，这比默认的 2048 位更安全。\n   * -c 后面跟的是一个注释，通常是你的邮箱地址，用于帮助你识别这个密钥。这个邮箱应该是你的 github 注册邮箱。\n\n# 3. 指定密钥保存位置\n\n * 当运行上述命令后，系统会询问你保存密钥的位置。如果你接受默认位置（通常是 ~/.ssh/id_rsa），直接按回车即可。如果你已经有了一个 ssh 密钥，系统会提示你是否要覆盖它。如果不想覆盖，可以输入一个新的文件名。\n\n# 4. 设置密钥密码\n\n * 接下来，系统会提示你输入一个密码（passphrase）。这是一个可选步骤，但为了增加安全性，建议设置一个密码。\n * 这个密码每次使用这个密钥时都会被要求输入，可以防止未经授权的用户使用你的密钥。\n * 输入密码后，系统会要求你再次确认。\n\n完成这些步骤后，你的新电脑上就会生成一个新的 ssh 密钥对。接下来，你需要将生成的公钥（.pub 文件）添加到你的 github 账户中，这样 github 就可以识别并信任从你的新电脑发出的 ssh 连接请求了。\n\n> 在 ssh 密钥生成过程中，当系统提示你输入密钥密码（passphrase）时，你可能注意到在输入时看不到任何反馈（例如星号或点），这是正常的。ssh 密钥生成工具为了安全考虑，不会在终端显示密码字符。即使你看不到输入的内容，你的输入是有效的。以下是这一步骤的详细说明：\n> \n> \n> # 输入 ssh 密钥密码\n> \n>  1. 输入密码时无可视反馈：\n>     \n>     *

连接\n\n完成公钥添加后，测试一下是否能够通过 ssh 连接到 github：\n\n * 打开终端或 git bash。\n * 输入以下命令：\n   \n   ssh -t git@github.com\n   \n   \n   1\n   \n   1\n   \n * 如果是第一次连接 github，可能会看到一个关于服务器身份的警告。输入 yes 继续。\n * 如果一切设置正确，你将看到一条欢迎信息，如：“hi [username]! you\'ve successfully authenticated, but github does not provide shell access.”\n\n这个欢迎信息表示 ssh 设置正确，并且你已经成功地通过 ssh 连接到了 github。\n\n\n\n# 五、开始使用 ssh 进行 git

checkout到了昨天上传出bug的那个版本，然后又checkout回去继续修改。一切修改完成后，commit成功，但push时报错如下\n\ntommyzeng@tommylaptop mingw64 /c/tommy/devprojectlocal/blog-vuepress (master|rebase 2/3)\n$ git push\nfatal: you are not

head。\n\n可能发生的问题：\n\ngit中的head指针能确定您当前的工作版本（以及放置在项目工作目录中的文件）。通常，当检出正确的分支名称时，git会在您创建新提交时自动移动head指针。您将自动进入所选分支的最新提交。\n\n当您选择通过commit哈希值进行checkout时，git将不会为您执行此操作。结果是，当您进行更改并提交它们时，这些更改将不属于任何分支。\n\n# 解决方法\n\n问题分析：出现该错误的原因是因为checkout导致的head指向了非master的仓库，导致push异常。\n\n可以先讲目前更改的commit放入一个临时分支里，然后切换至master分支，再使用命令和临时分支合并（merge）\n\n先查看下目前的commit列表\n\n43c3519 (head) head@{0}: commit: 新版字体优化合并分支

结合这篇文章，完整的配置流程一般1个小时可以配置完成。\n\n警告\n\n20230212：不知道因为什么原因，防火墙似乎有变动，会导致PICGO的日志中显示Git和PicGo等软件无法链接GitHub，造成各种因为链接不通畅而产生的错误，解决方法如下：\n\n 1. 访问IPaddress查询ip\n\n 2. 把140.82.112.4 github.com字段添加进电脑的Host文件，即可正常使用\n\n首先安装软件，软件下载地址，下载后直接安装即可，没有需要特别注意的点，默认路径即可。\n\n> 教程PICGO版本：2.4.0 beta6\n\n\n\n# 配置教程\n\n\n# 预准备\n\n安装完软件后建议先先安装picgo-plugin-github-plus插件\n\n> 这个插件非常好用，可以实现双向同步GitHub仓库的图片，而软件自带的GITHUB的只能存图不能删图，删除图片流程会很麻烦。\n\n安装方法:\n\n 1. 在软件界面左边点击插件设置，并在搜索框搜索github\n\n 2. 使用git bash客户端输入npm代码安装，npm的来源根据自己网络情况而定\n\nnpm install --location=global picgo-plugin-github-plus\n#为了实现全局安装，最新版的npm已经不推荐使用-g或-global了，建议使用--location=global。\n\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n\n安装完成后即可在picgo里找到github plus插件\n\n如果没有显示，则在picgo设置里找到并勾选,就会显示在图床设置中了\n\n\n\n# 图床配置\n\n点开图床设置，可以看到依次有六个选项\n\n\n\n\n\n# Repo\n\nrepo是repository的缩写也就是仓库路径,首先是要去GitHub建立一个仓库\n\n记得一定要选择public选项, 不然没法使用里面的图片\n\n> (所以这意味着所有图片别人都可以从你的仓库访问, 一定要注意上传的图片的脱敏性, 预防隐私泄露)\n\n\n\n新建好仓库后repo这一栏填写 "你的Github Id"/"仓库名" 即可\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Branch\n\n注意:这里再2020年之后就必须填成main, 因为GitHub把默认分支名字改了(因为master这个名字被网友喷了，说有种族歧视的意味)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Token\n\n这个是重点，目的是让PICGO能与Github完成信息确认与身份验证，避免其他人在得知你的仓库地址后乱传东西进取。操作方法如下：\n\n 1. 到GitHub设置里，点击头像找到setting\n\n 2. 左侧往下找到开发者设置\n\n 3. 自己新建一个token密钥\n\n\n\n\n\n几个关键的注意点：\n\n 1. 名字随便取，但尽量可以让自己以后看到了也知道这个token是干什么用的\n 2. 如果没有特殊要求，有效期选择无限时长即可\n 3. 下方需要勾选token的权限范围。picgo只需要勾选repo相关选项即可\n 4. 完成选项的填写与勾选后，点击该页面最下方generate token即可生成\n 5. 生成的TOKEN代码只会在本次的页面显示，刷新页面、重新加载后就会永久隐藏。也是为了保障token的安全，所以最好备份好(可在配置好的图床json文件中找到，详细路径请看文末), 否则只能再建一个token\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Path\n\n这个是存照片的路径，是用来指定仓库中的存储路径的，这里有个报错天坑，网上没什么人提到，就是一定要事前通过Git把要的文件夹创建好，否则软件识别不到路径就报错了，(且文件夹还不能是空的, GitHub空文件夹=不存在,赛个txt也好)，因此如果嫌麻烦可以空着，这样所有的照片都会出现在仓库的根目录，其实也不影响使用。\n\n具体教程参考这篇文章Git版本管理软件使用心得 - Tommy\'s Blog (tommyzeng.com)\n\n当建好后img文件夹后, 就可以写上,这样才能上传成功,否则一直报错,PicGo没权限建文件夹\n\n> 反正原版GitHub插件不可以，这个plus插件理论上权限更多，还没测试这样会不会报错，反正多做一步省得报错\n\nimg/\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# CustomUrl\n\n这个是自定义图片的呈现连接，可以通过这个功能接入第三方的CDN加速（CDN可以理解为一个提高访问速度的高速缓存服务，因为github的服务器国内很难直接访问，可能会导致图片无法显示或者很长时间才能加载出来）推荐使用jsdelivr的CDN服务加速，最大的优点就是免费，配置非常简单，就能大幅提高图片的访问速度\n\n不过Jsdelivr的服务有很多提供商，域名也大同小异，且不一定是每个都能用，这篇文章列举了各个服务商的可用域名，且提供了测试可否使用的测试链接，详情见：图床CDN可用JsDelivr配置更新\n\n配置方法：\n\nhttps://gcore.jsdelivr.net/gh/"你的GitHubid"/"仓库名字"\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#

Plus插件中，甚至完全没有提醒，直接进度条突然间跑完了，然后啥也没出现。\n\n总之，检验上传成功与否，最好的办法就是在上传完成后，在相册这一个窗口内出现了刚才上传的这个照片，就算成功，如果这里过了一会啥也没有，通常就是上传失败了。\n\n> 这里补充一下，github plus这个插件不受软件代理设置的影响，如果出现了网络问题导致的上传失败可以尝试在设置中配置科学上网信息，但通常只有软件自带的上传模块能正确代理，而插件则没办法绕过。之前网络问题导致过一段时间的这种情况的发生。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# 推荐设置\n\n\n# 常规设置\n\n推荐把更新助手关了,这个貌似会重置配置文件, 导致突然自己的配置文件没了\n\n时间戳重命名推荐打开, 因为时间久了不可避免会有名字重复的图片,这样子引用图片会出bug\n\n自启开着无妨,速度也不会被拖慢\n\n> 往下滑动有个上传后自动复制url的功能也推荐打开, 非常实用\n\n修改快捷键自己可以设置一个, 很多人第一次可能不懂这个快捷键怎么用,确实有点阴间,这个是上传剪贴板内的图片的,当图片位于剪贴板第一位时按下即可上传并自动复制url\n\n\n# 配置文件路径\n\n完成所有的陪之后，在以下路径即可找到完整的配置文件，该文件可以保存好，如果以后软件重装或者配置文件丢失，都可以通过这个文件快速替换恢复\n\nC:\\Users\\\'你的用户名\'\\AppData\\Roaming\\picgo\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n找到文件名叫data.json就是配置文件,建议自己设置好设置后复制一份放好,

在窗口中可直接点击按钮打开，此事会弹出一个记事本文件，里面会用时间戳的形式一行一行详细的记录软件各种操作执行的情况，如果报错，也会提示具体的报错代码。在报错的情况下，可以尝试把对应时间戳的信息复制到百度中查询，如果是特定时间段内统一出现的问题，那网上大概率可以找到很多问题解决的帖子，而且根据经验，绝大多数问题都是网络问题导致的。\n 3.

问题修复：翻页后取消显示首页banner\n\n在原生vdoing主题里，首页banner仅显示在第一页，翻页后不会显示，但是使用了这个插件后，虽然获得了很好的首页效果，但是每一页都会出现，反而影响了正常阅读。 经过研究，该插件的script部分对该效果生效没有任何影响，即使全部隐藏也能获得铺满的banner效果。问题出在style部分。\n\n经过多次尝试，发现这个问题是由于插件的样式故意定义了一个 important 导致的，导致了样式覆盖，hide-banner 无法正常执行，导致第二页也会出现 banner。 搜索一下代码并注释即可。\n\n.hide-banner {\n  display:

主题 和 butterfly 主题 别的主题也会有一些可以的，不过最好准备一个测试用的 HTML 文件 这里提供一个我自己生成的 22 年最新版 Hexo 部署教程-Win\n\n\n\n\n# 不完美的\n\n\n# 使用iframe 组件\n\n插入很多文件惯用的方法\n\n前置条件\n\n我把源文件放在了 \\Blog\\Source\\HTML 里, 并在通用配置文件_config.yml里设置了禁止渲染此目录下的文件, 禁用渲染教程请看这篇文章Hexo跳过渲染教程 正常的 iframe 有个问题是高度会自动限制在 100 多 px,很影响体验，直接变成了画中画，如果想变成整个页面的一部分，高度跟随文档长度，请使用以下代码，自行替换 src 路径\n\n<iframe src="/HTML/C-刷题笔记-持续更新。html"  style="width:100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" id="test" onload="this.height=100" ></iframe>\n<script type="text/javascript">\nfunction reinitIframe ( )\n{\n    var iframe = document.getElementById

height = Math.max ( bHeight, dHeight ) ;\n        iframe.height = height;\n        console.log ( height ) ;\n        }\n        catch ( ex ) {}\n}\nwindow.setInterval ( "reinitIframe ( ) ", 200 )

该方法的缺点:无法识别文章目录,字数\n\n\n\n\n# 较完美的方案\n\n目前是使用一款开源的md文档编辑器生成的html复制进要上传的文件中,可以实现较完美的效果\n\n> 目前发现支持的有fluid和butterfly主题, 有些主题魔改较多需要自行尝试可否正常渲染, G不G的出来public文件\n\n警告\n\n缺点: 此方法并非完美无缺, 目前最大的问题是代码展示框无法显示代码语言类别和行号, 都显示是yaml, 不过有一键复制代码的按钮, 还算可以接受 所以请评估自己是否特别需要清晰的代码块\n\n\nMD编辑器相关信息\n\n名称: Yank Note GitHub链接: https://github.com/purocean/yn 作者博客: https://blog-purocean.vercel.app/\n\n> 下载即可使用, 免费版也有绝大多数功能且完整可用, 完整版仅需38元, 理念特别不错, 安利大家用用 而且开发者可以直接微信找他, 有啥不懂都可以问, 全栈大佬\n\n\n提示\n\n这是 hexo跳过渲染 那篇文章的编辑格式, 几乎是直接复制生成的html即可\n\n> 前面的前言部分是为了让文章封面摘要正常显示,否则可能会显示代码\n\n\n\n#

两者都hexo都可以识别多级标题并生成目录\n\n\n# 包含样式代码修改\n\n警告\n\n使用包含样式的朋友看这里\n\n包含样式如果不在乎统计字数更推荐使用, 不过原代码直接使用可能会有bug, 请找到代码的这一行并把这个空行删掉\n\n.markdown-body .task-list-item input { margin: 0px 0.2em 0.25em -1.6em;

执行hexo渲染便可直接浏览啦\n\n\n\n\n# 结语\n\n这一通操作下来就可以形成全新的工作流, 即在一个文件夹里编辑所有的博客原稿, 在编辑完后生成html文件发布到自己的网站, 即可保证文章风格不需要额外调整, 也保证了自己的原稿可以保存在本地, 防止网站不弄了可独立的代码表达样式却无法在别处渲染\n\n当然最硬核的还是自己开发一个和主题和匹配的编辑器, 直接做到本地般和网页版原生样式同步\n\n欢迎在评论区发表自己的想法',normalizedContent:'# 前言 ( 持续更新，先更新到这先 )\n\n本身 hexo 是可以直接渲染 md 文件的，不过格式问题我在正经人中也有有提到，相信也会有人遇到和我同样的情形, 写点东西很多特殊格式得按主题要求的来, 一来二去还得写两个版本，结果发现不如简单粗暴的直接插入html，把自己想要的样式直接生成 html 文件放到博客中不就完美啦？因为本质上 hexo 也是把 md 渲染成 html 文件然后上传，打开网页更多像是在打开某个已经准备的好的 html\n\n下面就来分享一下我这段时间研究的各种插入 html 的奇葩方法\n\n重要提示\n\n目前能完美支持 html 插入的主题我暂时只知道 fluid 主题 和 butterfly 主题 别的主题也会有一些可以的，不过最好准备一个测试用的 html 文件 这里提供一个我自己生成的 22 年最新版 hexo 部署教程-win\n\n\n\n\n# 不完美的\n\n\n# 使用iframe 组件\n\n插入很多文件惯用的方法\n\n前置条件\n\n我把源文件放在了 \\blog\\source\\html 里, 并在通用配置文件_config.yml里设置了禁止渲染此目录下的文件, 禁用渲染教程请看这篇文章hexo跳过渲染教程 正常的 iframe 有个问题是高度会自动限制在 100 多 px,很影响体验，直接变成了画中画，如果想变成整个页面的一部分，高度跟随文档长度，请使用以下代码，自行替换 src 路径\n\n<iframe src="/html/c-刷题笔记-持续更新。html"  style="width:100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" id="test" onload="this.height=100" ></iframe>\n<script type="text/javascript">\nfunction reinitiframe ( )\n{\n    var iframe = document.getelementbyid ( "test" ) ;\n    try\n        {\n        var bheight = iframe.contentwindow.document.body.scrollheight;\n        var dheight = iframe.contentwindow.document.documentelement.scrollheight;\n        var height = math.max ( bheight, dheight ) ;\n        iframe.height = height;\n        console.log ( height ) ;\n        }\n        catch ( ex ) {}\n}\nwindow.setinterval ( "reinitiframe ( ) ", 200 )

该方法的缺点:无法识别文章目录,字数\n\n\n\n\n# 较完美的方案\n\n目前是使用一款开源的md文档编辑器生成的html复制进要上传的文件中,可以实现较完美的效果\n\n> 目前发现支持的有fluid和butterfly主题, 有些主题魔改较多需要自行尝试可否正常渲染, g不g的出来public文件\n\n警告\n\n缺点: 此方法并非完美无缺, 目前最大的问题是代码展示框无法显示代码语言类别和行号, 都显示是yaml, 不过有一键复制代码的按钮, 还算可以接受 所以请评估自己是否特别需要清晰的代码块\n\n\nmd编辑器相关信息\n\n名称: yank note github链接: https://github.com/purocean/yn 作者博客: https://blog-purocean.vercel.app/\n\n> 下载即可使用, 免费版也有绝大多数功能且完整可用, 完整版仅需38元, 理念特别不错, 安利大家用用 而且开发者可以直接微信找他, 有啥不懂都可以问, 全栈大佬\n\n\n提示\n\n这是 hexo跳过渲染 那篇文章的编辑格式, 几乎是直接复制生成的html即可\n\n> 前面的前言部分是为了让文章封面摘要正常显示,否则可能会显示代码\n\n\n\n# 代码实际演示，想测试的可以直接粘贴本代码到要post的md文档里渲染测试下\n\n---\ntitle: (hexo)文件跳过渲染\ndate: 2022-04-10 15:57:37\ntags: [操作分享,避坑指南]\n---\n## 前言\n根目录下的`source`文件夹可以存放多类文件作为静态网站的资源库, 但是由于hexo的特性, 会把所有该目录下的文件渲染掉,

两者都hexo都可以识别多级标题并生成目录\n\n\n# 包含样式代码修改\n\n警告\n\n使用包含样式的朋友看这里\n\n包含样式如果不在乎统计字数更推荐使用, 不过原代码直接使用可能会有bug, 请找到代码的这一行并把这个空行删掉\n\n.markdown-body .task-list-item input { margin: 0px 0.2em 0.25em -1.6em;

直接做到本地般和网页版原生样式同步\n\n欢迎在评论区发表自己的想法',charsets:{cjk:!0},lastUpdated:"2025/05/30

若参与运算量的类型不同，则先转换成同一类型，然后进行运算。转换类型按以下几个顺序进行：\n\n 1. 转换按数据长度增加的方向进行，以保证精度不降低。如intint型和longlon**g型运算时，先把intint量转成longlon**g型后再进行运算。\n 2. 若两种类型的字节数不同，转换成字节数高的类型\n 3. 若两种类型的字节数相同，且一种有符号，一种无符号，则转换成无符号类型\n 4. 所有的浮点运算都是以双精度进行的，即使仅含float单精度量运算的表达式，也要先转换成double型，再作运算\n 5. char型和 short型参与运算时，必须先转换成int\n\n\n# P2433 综合题(数学根号,幂运算库math.h)\n\n问题 1\n\n请输出 I love Luogu!\n\n问题 2\n\n这里有 10 个苹果，小A 拿走了 2 个，Uim 拿走了 4

若参与运算量的类型不同，则先转换成同一类型，然后进行运算。转换类型按以下几个顺序进行：\n\n 1. 转换按数据长度增加的方向进行，以保证精度不降低。如intint型和longlon**g型运算时，先把intint量转成longlon**g型后再进行运算。\n 2. 若两种类型的字节数不同，转换成字节数高的类型\n 3. 若两种类型的字节数相同，且一种有符号，一种无符号，则转换成无符号类型\n 4. 所有的浮点运算都是以双精度进行的，即使仅含float单精度量运算的表达式，也要先转换成double型，再作运算\n 5. char型和 short型参与运算时，必须先转换成int\n\n\n# p2433 综合题(数学根号,幂运算库math.h)\n\n问题 1\n\n请输出 i love luogu!\n\n问题 2\n\n这里有 10 个苹果，小a 拿走了 2 个，uim 拿走了 4

iostream 头文件的一些主要特点和组件：\n\n 1. 标准流对象：\n    \n    * cin：标准输入流，通常用于从键盘读取输入。\n    * cout：标准输出流，用于向屏幕输出数据。\n    * cerr：标准错误流，用于输出错误消息到屏幕，不经过缓冲区，直接输出。\n    * clog：类似于 cerr，但输出通过缓冲区，用于输出日志信息。\n\n 2. 输入/输出操作符：\n    \n    * >>：从 cin 读取数据的提取操作符。\n    * <<：向 cout, cerr, 或 clog 写入数据的插入操作符。\n\n 3. 操纵符：用于改变流的格式或行为的函数，如 endl（用于插入换行符并刷新输出缓冲区）、std::setw（设置字段宽度）、std::setprecision（设置浮点数的精度）等。\n\n 4. 流状态标志：用于检查和设置流的状态（如错误状态）的功能。\n\niostream 头文件非常重要，因为它提供了与用户交互的基本机制。例如，它使得从标准输入读取数据以及将数据输出到标准输出成为可能，这对于控制台程序来说非常关键。\n\n一个基本的使用 iostream 的示例：\n\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int number;\n    cout << "Enter a number: ";\n    cin >> number;\n    cout << "You entered " << number << endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\n\n在这个程序中，我们使用 cin 来从用户那里接收一个数字，并使用 cout 来输出这个数字。endl 用于在输出的末尾添加一个换行符，并刷新输出缓冲区，确保立即显示输出。\n\n\n# include<vector>动态数组\n\n在C++标准模板库（STL）中，<vector> 头文件提供了 std::vector 类，这是一个动态数组的实现。std::vector 是一种序列容器，它可以存储具有相同类型的元素，并支持随机访问。\n\n以下是 std::vector 的一些主要特点：\n\n 1. 动态数组：vector 的大小可以在运行时动态改变。它可以根据需要自动扩容和缩容。\n\n 2. 连续存储：vector 中的元素是在连续的内存空间中存储的，这意味着它支持快速的随机访问。\n\n 3. 操作：\n    \n    * push_back：在 vector 的末尾添加一个元素。\n    * pop_back：移除 vector 末尾的元素。\n    * insert：在指定位置插入一个或多个元素。\n    * erase：删除指定位置或范围内的元素。\n    * clear：移除所有元素，使 vector 为空。\n    * size：返回 vector 中的元素数量。\n    * resize：改变 vector 的大小。\n    * [] 运算符和 at 方法：用于访问 vector 中的元素。\n\n 4. 性能特点：\n    \n    * 插入和删除操作在 vector 的末尾是高效的，但在中间或开始位置可能需要移动元素，因此可能较慢。\n    * 提供高效的随机访问，即直接访问任何位置的元素。\n    * 当 vector 的容量不足以容纳更多元素时，会自动重新分配更大的内存空间来扩容，这个操作的时间复杂度是线性的。\n\n 5. 用途：适用于需要快速随机访问元素的场景，以及元素的添加和移除主要发生在序列的末尾。\n\n在使用 std::vector 时，你需要包含 <vector> 头文件。由于 vector 是模板类，你可以用它来存储任何类型的元素，例如 std::vector<int>、std::vector<std::string> 等。\n\nstd::vector 是最常用的 STL 容器之一，因为它提供了高度灵活的数据结构，同时具备数组的许多优点。在实际编程中，vector 通常是默认的序列容器选择，除非有特定的理由要求使用其他类型的容器。\n\n\n# include<deque>双端队列\n\ndeque 在C++标准模板库（STL）中的全称是 "Double-Ended Queue"，即双端队列。它是一种允许在容器两端（即头部和尾部）高效插入和删除元素的序列容器。\n\ndeque 的特点包括：\n\n * 提供对头部和尾部元素的快速访问。\n * 支持在头部和尾部高效地插入和删除元素。\n * 支持随机访问，即可以通过索引直接访问任何元素。\n * 内部实现通常比 vector 复杂，因此当只需要在尾部添加或删除元素时，vector 可能是更好的选择。\n\n由于 deque 提供了在两端操作的灵活性，它在需要这种特性的场景下非常有用，如在实现某些算法或数据结构（例如队列和广度优先搜索算法）时。\n\n\n# include<list>链表\n\n在C++标准模板库（STL）中，<list> 头文件提供了 std::list 容器类，这是一个双向链表的实现。std::list 允许快速的插入和删除操作，它主要用于那些需要频繁插入和删除元素，且不需要快速随机访问的场合。\n\n以下是 std::list 的一些主要特点：\n\n 1. 动态大小：与数组不同，list 的大小不是固定的，可以根据需要动态增长或缩减。\n\n 2. 非连续存储：list 中的元素不是连续存储的，而是通过指针链接在一起。这意味着它允许常数时间内的元素插入和删除，但不支持快速随机访问。\n\n 3. 双向迭代：list 提供双向迭代，你可以从头到尾或从尾到头遍历列表。\n\n 4. 操作：\n    \n    * push_front 和 push_back：在列表的前端或后端添加一个元素。\n    * pop_front 和 pop_back：从列表的前端或后端移除一个元素。\n    * insert：在指定位置插入一个或多个元素。\n    * erase：删除指定位置或范围内的元素。\n    * clear：移除所有元素，使列表为空。\n    * size：返回列表中的元素数量。\n    * sort：对列表元素进行排序。\n    * reverse：反转列表中元素的顺序。\n\n 5. 性能特点：\n    \n    * 插入和删除操作通常是常数时间复杂度，与列表的大小无关。\n    * 由于元素不是连续存储的，遍历 list 比遍历 vector 或数组要慢。\n    * 不支持通过索引直接访问元素。\n\n 6. 用途：适用于元素经常被插入或删除，且不需要快速随机访问的场景。\n\n在使用 std::list 时，你需要包含 <list> 头文件。由于 list 是模板类，你可以用它来存储任何类型的元素，例如 std::list<int>、std::list<std::string> 等。\n\n在选择容器类型时，了解不同容器的特点和适用场景非常重要。对于需要快速随机访问的场合，std::vector 或数组可能是更好的选择；而对于频繁的插入和删除操作，特别是在序列的两端，std::list 或 std::deque 更为合适。\n\n\n# 如何自己编写头文件\n\n头文件是可以自定义的，在C++中，头文件通常用于声明函数、类、模板和全局变量等，这样它们就可以在多个源文件中被重用。头文件有助于组织代码、提高可维护性，并促进模块化编程。\n\n创建头文件的基本步骤如下：\n\n\n# 1. 创建头文件\n\n创建一个扩展名为 .h 或 .hpp 的文件。例如，my_functions.h。\n\n\n# 2. 写入代码\n\n在头文件中，您可以包含如下内容：\n\n * 函数原型（声明）\n * 类定义\n * 模板定义\n * 全局变量的声明\n * 宏定义\n * 其他头文件的包含\n\n例如，一个简单的头文件可能包含一个函数的声明：\n\n// my_functions.h\n#ifndef MY_FUNCTIONS_H\n#define MY_FUNCTIONS_H\n\nvoid PrintHelloWorld();\n\n#endif // MY_FUNCTIONS_H\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\n\n\n# 3. 使用头文件防护\n\n为了防止头文件内容在同一个编译单元中被包含（#include）多次，通常使用预处理指令 #ifndef、#define 和 #endif 来创建所谓的 "include guards"。在上面的例子中，MY_FUNCTIONS_H 就是一个守卫宏。\n\n\n# 4. 在源文件中包含头文件\n\n在您的 .cpp 源文件中，使用 #include "my_functions.h" 来包含并使用头文件中声明的内容。\n\n// main.cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include "my_functions.h"\n\nvoid PrintHelloWorld() {\n    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    PrintHelloWorld();\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n\n\n在上面的例子中，PrintHelloWorld 函数在 my_functions.h 中声明，在 main.cpp 中定义，并在 main 函数中调用。\n\n\n# 5. 编译\n\n编译您的程序时，确保包含所有相关的 .cpp 文件。头文件本身不会被直接编译，但它们在预处理阶段被包含在源文件中。\n\n创建和使用自定义头文件是一种很好的实践，尤其是在较大的项目中，因为它有助于将声明和实现分离，使代码更清晰、更易于管理。\n\n\n# 6. 路径管理\n\n前面没有提到路径如何管理，这也是确保头文件起作用很重要的一步。\n\n在C++中，包含（或导入）头文件时，头文件的路径可以根据其相对于源文件的位置或是相对于编译器的搜索路径来指定。头文件的路径可以用双引号 "" 或尖括号 <> 来指定，两者在搜索路径上有所不同。\n\n# 使用双引号 ""\n\n当使用双引号包含头文件时，如 #include "my_header.h"，编译器首先在源文件的当前目录中查找头文件。如果在当前目录中没有找到，它将按照编译器的搜索路径继续查找。这通常用于你自己编写的头文件或者特定于项目的头文件。\n\n例如：\n\n#include "my_header.h"  // 查找当前目录下的my_header.h\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n# 使用尖括号 <>\n\n当使用尖括号包含头文件时，如 #include <iostream>，编译器直接在其标准库目录和其他配置的库目录中搜索头文件。这主要用于标准库头文件或第三方库头文件。\n\n例如：\n\n#include <iostream>  // 查找标准库中的iostream\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n# 指定头文件路径\n\n如果头文件不在当前目录或标准库路径中，你需要告诉编译器去哪里查找这些文件。这可以通过以下几种方式实现：\n\n 1. 使用相对路径： 如果头文件位于源文件所在目录的子目录中，可以使用相对路径。\n    \n    #include "subdir/my_header.h"  // 在子目录中查找\n    \n    \n    1\n    \n    1\n    \n\n 2. 使用绝对路径： 直接指定头文件的完整路径（不推荐，因为降低了代码的可移植性）。\n    \n    #include "/path/to/my_header.h"\n    \n    \n    1\n    \n    1\n    \n\n 3. 编译器的 include 路径： 在编译时，可以通过编译器的命令行选项指定额外的 include 路径。例如，对于 GCC 和 Clang，可以使用 -I 选项。\n    \n    g++ -I/path/to/headers my_program.cpp\n    \n    \n    1\n    \n    1\n    \n    \n    这告诉编译器在 /path/to/headers 目录中也查找头文件。\n\n# 小提示\n\n保持项目的组织结构清晰，将头文件放在合适的目录中，可以避免很多关于路径的问题。对于较大的项目，通常有一个专门的目录（如 include）来存放所有头文件。',normalizedContent:'# include<iostream>\n\n这是最常用的头文件，在c++中，#include <iostream> 是一条预处理指令，用于包含标准库中的 iostream 头文件。iostream 是c++标准库的一部分，主要用于输入和输出操作。\n\n以下是 iostream 头文件的一些主要特点和组件：\n\n 1. 标准流对象：\n    \n    * cin：标准输入流，通常用于从键盘读取输入。\n    * cout：标准输出流，用于向屏幕输出数据。\n    * cerr：标准错误流，用于输出错误消息到屏幕，不经过缓冲区，直接输出。\n    * clog：类似于 cerr，但输出通过缓冲区，用于输出日志信息。\n\n 2. 输入/输出操作符：\n    \n    * >>：从 cin 读取数据的提取操作符。\n    * <<：向 cout, cerr, 或 clog 写入数据的插入操作符。\n\n 3. 操纵符：用于改变流的格式或行为的函数，如 endl（用于插入换行符并刷新输出缓冲区）、std::setw（设置字段宽度）、std::setprecision（设置浮点数的精度）等。\n\n 4. 流状态标志：用于检查和设置流的状态（如错误状态）的功能。\n\niostream 头文件非常重要，因为它提供了与用户交互的基本机制。例如，它使得从标准输入读取数据以及将数据输出到标准输出成为可能，这对于控制台程序来说非常关键。\n\n一个基本的使用 iostream 的示例：\n\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    int number;\n    cout << "enter a number: ";\n    cin >> number;\n    cout << "you entered " << number << endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\n\n在这个程序中，我们使用 cin 来从用户那里接收一个数字，并使用 cout 来输出这个数字。endl 用于在输出的末尾添加一个换行符，并刷新输出缓冲区，确保立即显示输出。\n\n\n# include<vector>动态数组\n\n在c++标准模板库（stl）中，<vector> 头文件提供了 std::vector 类，这是一个动态数组的实现。std::vector 是一种序列容器，它可以存储具有相同类型的元素，并支持随机访问。\n\n以下是 std::vector 的一些主要特点：\n\n 1. 动态数组：vector 的大小可以在运行时动态改变。它可以根据需要自动扩容和缩容。\n\n 2. 连续存储：vector 中的元素是在连续的内存空间中存储的，这意味着它支持快速的随机访问。\n\n 3. 操作：\n    \n    * push_back：在 vector 的末尾添加一个元素。\n    * pop_back：移除 vector 末尾的元素。\n    * insert：在指定位置插入一个或多个元素。\n    * erase：删除指定位置或范围内的元素。\n    * clear：移除所有元素，使 vector 为空。\n    * size：返回 vector 中的元素数量。\n    * resize：改变 vector 的大小。\n    * [] 运算符和 at 方法：用于访问 vector 中的元素。\n\n 4. 性能特点：\n    \n    * 插入和删除操作在 vector 的末尾是高效的，但在中间或开始位置可能需要移动元素，因此可能较慢。\n    * 提供高效的随机访问，即直接访问任何位置的元素。\n    * 当 vector 的容量不足以容纳更多元素时，会自动重新分配更大的内存空间来扩容，这个操作的时间复杂度是线性的。\n\n 5. 用途：适用于需要快速随机访问元素的场景，以及元素的添加和移除主要发生在序列的末尾。\n\n在使用 std::vector 时，你需要包含 <vector> 头文件。由于 vector 是模板类，你可以用它来存储任何类型的元素，例如 std::vector<int>、std::vector<std::string> 等。\n\nstd::vector 是最常用的 stl 容器之一，因为它提供了高度灵活的数据结构，同时具备数组的许多优点。在实际编程中，vector 通常是默认的序列容器选择，除非有特定的理由要求使用其他类型的容器。\n\n\n# include<deque>双端队列\n\ndeque 在c++标准模板库（stl）中的全称是 "double-ended queue"，即双端队列。它是一种允许在容器两端（即头部和尾部）高效插入和删除元素的序列容器。\n\ndeque 的特点包括：\n\n * 提供对头部和尾部元素的快速访问。\n * 支持在头部和尾部高效地插入和删除元素。\n * 支持随机访问，即可以通过索引直接访问任何元素。\n * 内部实现通常比 vector 复杂，因此当只需要在尾部添加或删除元素时，vector 可能是更好的选择。\n\n由于 deque 提供了在两端操作的灵活性，它在需要这种特性的场景下非常有用，如在实现某些算法或数据结构（例如队列和广度优先搜索算法）时。\n\n\n# include<list>链表\n\n在c++标准模板库（stl）中，<list> 头文件提供了 std::list 容器类，这是一个双向链表的实现。std::list 允许快速的插入和删除操作，它主要用于那些需要频繁插入和删除元素，且不需要快速随机访问的场合。\n\n以下是 std::list 的一些主要特点：\n\n 1. 动态大小：与数组不同，list 的大小不是固定的，可以根据需要动态增长或缩减。\n\n 2. 非连续存储：list 中的元素不是连续存储的，而是通过指针链接在一起。这意味着它允许常数时间内的元素插入和删除，但不支持快速随机访问。\n\n 3. 双向迭代：list 提供双向迭代，你可以从头到尾或从尾到头遍历列表。\n\n 4. 操作：\n    \n    * push_front 和 push_back：在列表的前端或后端添加一个元素。\n    * pop_front 和 pop_back：从列表的前端或后端移除一个元素。\n    * insert：在指定位置插入一个或多个元素。\n    * erase：删除指定位置或范围内的元素。\n    * clear：移除所有元素，使列表为空。\n    * size：返回列表中的元素数量。\n    * sort：对列表元素进行排序。\n    * reverse：反转列表中元素的顺序。\n\n 5. 性能特点：\n    \n    * 插入和删除操作通常是常数时间复杂度，与列表的大小无关。\n    * 由于元素不是连续存储的，遍历 list 比遍历 vector 或数组要慢。\n    * 不支持通过索引直接访问元素。\n\n 6. 用途：适用于元素经常被插入或删除，且不需要快速随机访问的场景。\n\n在使用 std::list 时，你需要包含 <list> 头文件。由于 list 是模板类，你可以用它来存储任何类型的元素，例如 std::list<int>、std::list<std::string> 等。\n\n在选择容器类型时，了解不同容器的特点和适用场景非常重要。对于需要快速随机访问的场合，std::vector 或数组可能是更好的选择；而对于频繁的插入和删除操作，特别是在序列的两端，std::list 或 std::deque 更为合适。\n\n\n#

  push_back 是 std::vector 的一个成员函数，用于在 vector 的末尾添加一个新元素。 当你调用 numbers.push_back(num); 时，num 的值被添加到 vector numbers 的末尾。 这意味着你不需要预先知道 vector 中将存储多少个元素，因为 vector 会根据需要动态地调整其大小。\n\n 2. numbers.size() - 1:\n    \n    size()是std::vector的另一个成员函数，它返回 vector 中当前元素的数量。 在 C++ 中，vector 的索引是从 0 开始的。这意味着如果 vector 有 N 个元素，它们的索引将是从 0 到 N-1。\n    \n    因此，numbers.size() - 1实际上是获取 vector 中最后一个元素的索引。 在这个问题中，我们需要从 vector 的末尾开始反向遍历，所以我们从索引 numbers.size() - 1（即最后一个元素）开始。\n\n\n# LG P5727 冰雹猜想\n\n题目描述\n\n给出一个正整数 nnn，然后对这个数字一直进行下面的操作：如果这个数字是奇数，那么将其乘 333 再加 111，否则除以 222。经过若干次循环后，最终都会回到

&（即不使用引用传递），程序仍然可以运行，但它将无法按预期工作。原因在于不使用引用传递意味着函数将接收 digitCount 向量的一个副本，而非原始向量本身。\n\n不使用引用传递的后果是：\n\n 1. 副本创建：当 digitCount 作为参数传递给 countDigits 函数时，将创建它的一个副本。这意味着在函数内部对 digitCount 所做的任何更改都只会影响这个副本，而不会影响原始向量。\n\n 2. 无法更新原始向量：由于 digitCount 在函数中是一个副本，因此函数内对其的修改不会反映到调用函数时使用的原始向量中。这意味着尽管函数可能正确地计算了数字的出现次数，但这些计算结果不会被保存到原始的 digitCount 向量中。\n\n 3. 性能问题：对于大型数据结构（如向量），创建副本可能会导致不必要的性能开销。\n\n因此，如果你希望 countDigits 函数能够实际更新传递给它的 digitCount 向量，你应该使用引用传递（即在参数前加上 &）。这确保了函数内对向量所做的任何更改都会直接反映到原始向量上，从而使得这些更改在函数外部也是有效的。',normalizedContent:'# hw机考

  push_back 是 std::vector 的一个成员函数，用于在 vector 的末尾添加一个新元素。 当你调用 numbers.push_back(num); 时，num 的值被添加到 vector numbers 的末尾。 这意味着你不需要预先知道 vector 中将存储多少个元素，因为 vector 会根据需要动态地调整其大小。\n\n 2. numbers.size() - 1:\n    \n    size()是std::vector的另一个成员函数，它返回 vector 中当前元素的数量。 在 c++ 中，vector 的索引是从 0 开始的。这意味着如果 vector 有 n 个元素，它们的索引将是从 0 到 n-1。\n    \n    因此，numbers.size() - 1实际上是获取 vector 中最后一个元素的索引。 在这个问题中，我们需要从

知识点思考\n\n在代码开头写了一个辅助函数，用来辅助后面的运算，可以看到在这个位置\n\nvector<int>& digitcount\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n使用了&这个符号，这个符号的意思是引用符号，意味着这个动态数组将会直接被引用，在这个特定的情况下，如果你在 countdigits 函数的参数中不使用 &（即不使用引用传递），程序仍然可以运行，但它将无法按预期工作。原因在于不使用引用传递意味着函数将接收 digitcount 向量的一个副本，而非原始向量本身。\n\n不使用引用传递的后果是：\n\n 1. 副本创建：当 digitcount 作为参数传递给 countdigits 函数时，将创建它的一个副本。这意味着在函数内部对 digitcount 所做的任何更改都只会影响这个副本，而不会影响原始向量。\n\n 2. 无法更新原始向量：由于 digitcount 在函数中是一个副本，因此函数内对其的修改不会反映到调用函数时使用的原始向量中。这意味着尽管函数可能正确地计算了数字的出现次数，但这些计算结果不会被保存到原始的 digitcount 向量中。\n\n 3. 性能问题：对于大型数据结构（如向量），创建副本可能会导致不必要的性能开销。\n\n因此，如果你希望 countdigits 函数能够实际更新传递给它的 digitcount 向量，你应该使用引用传递（即在参数前加上 &）。这确保了函数内对向量所做的任何更改都会直接反映到原始向量上，从而使得这些更改在函数外部也是有效的。',charsets:{cjk:!0},lastUpdated:"2025/05/30

正式版本：\n\n新中国成立后，毛泽东在出访苏联时，斯大林建议毛泽东出版自己的文集。毛泽东接受了这一建议。1950年5月，中共中央政治局正式决定成立毛泽东选集编辑委员会，由刘少奇担任主任。具体编辑工作由陈伯达负责领导，胡乔木和田家英协助，全部文稿经过毛泽东本人修改审定。\n\n# 《毛泽东选集》第一版:\n\n官方权威版本。经过本人参与修改编辑和同意的版本，也是供人没有争议的版本。\n\n《毛泽东选集》第一卷 《毛泽东选集》第二卷 《毛泽东选集》第三卷 《毛泽东选集》第四卷 《毛泽东选集》第五卷\n\n\n第一卷：包括毛泽东1925年起到抗日战争爆发前的文章共17篇，1951年10月12日由人民出版社正式出版发行。\n\n第二卷：包括毛泽东在抗日战争前期的文章共40篇，1952年4月10日由人民出版社正式出版发行。\n\n第三卷：包括毛泽东在抗日战争后期的文章共31篇，1953年4月10日由人民出版社正式出版发行。\n\n第四卷：包括毛泽东在抗日战争后到建国前的文章共70篇，1960年9月30日由人民出版社正式出版发行。本卷由胡乔木主持编定后，毛泽东通读通过。\n\n出版后，中共中央又设立了毛泽东著作翻译室，将毛选四卷翻译为多种外语出版，此后该翻译室逐渐发展为中共中央文献翻译部。另外，除上述四卷分册的版本外，还有四卷合一的“一卷本”。 第五卷包括毛泽东在中华人民共和国建国后的文章共70篇，截至1957年。1977年4月15日由人民出版社正式出版发行。 毛泽东逝世后，华国锋决定继续出版毛选第五卷，在击溃四人帮后，于1976年10月8日再度开始筹备工作，由汪东兴为名义负责人，李鑫、吴泠西、胡绳、熊复实际负责编辑工作。\n\n第六卷：第五卷出版后，华国锋仍保留了毛泽东选集编辑委员会，准备筹备出版毛选第六卷（未出版）。\n\n1980年，毛泽东选集编辑委员会改组为中共中央文献研究室，此后未再出版毛选。已发售的毛选第五卷，也在1982年后停售，目前只能在一些二手书刊交易平台购得。"\n\n为了最终弥补“毛选只有部分毛泽东文章，尤其没有建国后文章”的缺憾，中共中央在1990年代又组织编印了《毛泽东文集》、《毛泽东早期文稿》（内部发行）、《建国以来毛泽东文稿》（内部发行）等著作集。\n\n\n# 《毛泽东选集》第二版\n\n根据中共中央的决定，中共中央文献研究室对《毛泽东选集》第一至四卷进行修订，在中国共产党建立七十周年之际（1991年）出版第二版。\n\n与上一版相比，这一版本除了对个别字句进行了勘误和订正，还增加了毛泽东于1930年所写的《反对本本主义》一文，并在附录部分收录了中共七大通过的、并非毛泽东著作的《关于若干历史问题的决议》一文。《毛选》第二版由邓小平题写封面书名。\n\n\n# 民间版本：\n\n五卷以后，中国进入改革开放时期，再未有过官方的后续卷本，然而民间流传出至少三个版本的毛选第六卷、第七卷。比较有名的有三个版本：润之赤旗、静火和草堂。\n\n# 静火版\n\n静火版的文章收录比较讲究，不是所有的文章都收集入卷，校对和编辑做的很棒，水平在线，所以我首推这个版本的毛选补充，我收集到的版本是第六卷更新到4.0版，第七卷更新到2.0版，其实与旧版差别不大，大多是排版校对的问题。\n\n之前网络比较宽松的时候是可以查到很多关于静火的信息，很多人对其的称呼都是“静火奶奶”，她在序言中也自称“老朽”。后来对其身份的猜测有很多，说她是美国人，也有说她是之前毛的秘书，如果真的是秘书我倒是觉得不奇怪了，难怪文章选取的好。\n\n# 润之赤旗版\n\n这个版本与静火版的很相似，所参考的文献大致相同，但是排版上不同，收录的文章数量极多，远超静火版。到现在也补充了六、七两卷，可惜的是文章顺序放置的乱，不怎么顺畅，更像是一个集合。不过编者意识到这个问题了，不停地在修改，到现在已经更新到3.0版了。\n\n# 草堂版\n\n这个版本只有第六卷，文章收录数量中等，不多不少。我只看了目录，排版有待于进步。编者草堂闲人出处不详，可能确实是民间爱好者编纂，基本上这个版本的文章上两个版本都有，估计会有相互借鉴相互参考。\n\n\n\n# 毛选全集的资料清单\n\n黄皮版（官方第二版）\n\n全套版（官方第一版）\n\n英文版（不全）\n\nkindle版\n\n\n#

《毛泽东选集》第五卷\n\n\n第一卷：包括毛泽东1925年起到抗日战争爆发前的文章共17篇，1951年10月12日由人民出版社正式出版发行。\n\n第二卷：包括毛泽东在抗日战争前期的文章共40篇，1952年4月10日由人民出版社正式出版发行。\n\n第三卷：包括毛泽东在抗日战争后期的文章共31篇，1953年4月10日由人民出版社正式出版发行。\n\n第四卷：包括毛泽东在抗日战争后到建国前的文章共70篇，1960年9月30日由人民出版社正式出版发行。本卷由胡乔木主持编定后，毛泽东通读通过。\n\n出版后，中共中央又设立了毛泽东著作翻译室，将毛选四卷翻译为多种外语出版，此后该翻译室逐渐发展为中共中央文献翻译部。另外，除上述四卷分册的版本外，还有四卷合一的“一卷本”。 第五卷包括毛泽东在中华人民共和国建国后的文章共70篇，截至1957年。1977年4月15日由人民出版社正式出版发行。 毛泽东逝世后，华国锋决定继续出版毛选第五卷，在击溃四人帮后，于1976年10月8日再度开始筹备工作，由汪东兴为名义负责人，李鑫、吴泠西、胡绳、熊复实际负责编辑工作。\n\n第六卷：第五卷出版后，华国锋仍保留了毛泽东选集编辑委员会，准备筹备出版毛选第六卷（未出版）。\n\n1980年，毛泽东选集编辑委员会改组为中共中央文献研究室，此后未再出版毛选。已发售的毛选第五卷，也在1982年后停售，目前只能在一些二手书刊交易平台购得。"\n\n为了最终弥补“毛选只有部分毛泽东文章，尤其没有建国后文章”的缺憾，中共中央在1990年代又组织编印了《毛泽东文集》、《毛泽东早期文稿》（内部发行）、《建国以来毛泽东文稿》（内部发行）等著作集。\n\n\n# 《毛泽东选集》第二版\n\n根据中共中央的决定，中共中央文献研究室对《毛泽东选集》第一至四卷进行修订，在中国共产党建立七十周年之际（1991年）出版第二版。\n\n与上一版相比，这一版本除了对个别字句进行了勘误和订正，还增加了毛泽东于1930年所写的《反对本本主义》一文，并在附录部分收录了中共七大通过的、并非毛泽东著作的《关于若干历史问题的决议》一文。《毛选》第二版由邓小平题写封面书名。\n\n\n# 民间版本：\n\n五卷以后，中国进入改革开放时期，再未有过官方的后续卷本，然而民间流传出至少三个版本的毛选第六卷、第七卷。比较有名的有三个版本：润之赤旗、静火和草堂。\n\n# 静火版\n\n静火版的文章收录比较讲究，不是所有的文章都收集入卷，校对和编辑做的很棒，水平在线，所以我首推这个版本的毛选补充，我收集到的版本是第六卷更新到4.0版，第七卷更新到2.0版，其实与旧版差别不大，大多是排版校对的问题。\n\n之前网络比较宽松的时候是可以查到很多关于静火的信息，很多人对其的称呼都是“静火奶奶”，她在序言中也自称“老朽”。后来对其身份的猜测有很多，说她是美国人，也有说她是之前毛的秘书，如果真的是秘书我倒是觉得不奇怪了，难怪文章选取的好。\n\n# 润之赤旗版\n\n这个版本与静火版的很相似，所参考的文献大致相同，但是排版上不同，收录的文章数量极多，远超静火版。到现在也补充了六、七两卷，可惜的是文章顺序放置的乱，不怎么顺畅，更像是一个集合。不过编者意识到这个问题了，不停地在修改，到现在已经更新到3.0版了。\n\n# 草堂版\n\n这个版本只有第六卷，文章收录数量中等，不多不少。我只看了目录，排版有待于进步。编者草堂闲人出处不详，可能确实是民间爱好者编纂，基本上这个版本的文章上两个版本都有，估计会有相互借鉴相互参考。\n\n\n\n# 毛选全集的资料清单\n\n黄皮版（官方第二版）\n\n全套版（官方第一版）\n\n英文版（不全）\n\nkindle版\n\n\n#

The background of history: Ⅱ. The preface discusses the importance of investigation in many ways, but more importantly, it emphasizes the attitude one should have toward investigation.",content:"# 3.1 The Preface and Epilogue of the Rural Investigation\n\n\n# Ⅰ. The background of history:\n\nThis piece was written in the context of the Yan’an Rectification Movement. Strictly speaking, it is not an article, but rather a preface and an epilogue composed by Mao Zedong as part of an educational material.\n\nA preface refers to the introductory section at the beginning of a long article. An epilogue refers to a concluding section at the end of a long article. The third volume of the Selected Works opens with the preface and epilogue from Rural Investigation, which carries profound significance.\n\nSo, when we talk about rectification, what kind of style is it exactly that needs to be rectified?\n\nAt that time, there were mainly three styles: subjectivism, dogmatism, and sectarianism. All three forms of rectification referred to various aspects within the Party, including attitudes toward learning, working methods, and writing styles. Therefore, Mao Zedong also emphasized the need to rectify the Party’s work style, academic style, and rigid, formulaic writing styles that hindered clear thinking and genuine expression, among others.\n\n * To rectify these unhealthy tendencies, one crucial and indispensable method is to highlight and promote their opposites.\n * To combat the style of subjectivism, one must promote the spirit of conducting investigations based on practical realities.\n * To combat the style of dogmatism, one must promote the spirit of seeking truth from facts and applying theory to practical situations.\n * To combat the style of sectarianism, one must promote the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, and of unity in looking forward together.\n\nIn other words, when addressing an unhealthy tendency, it is essential to clearly point out the correct, positive tendencies. Only through such contrasts can a stronger and more profound understanding be achieved.\n\nIn the case of dogmatism and subjectivism, their best counterexamples are precisely the styles of 'seeking truth from facts' and 'integrating theory with practice.' Among these admirable work styles, the most immediate and actionable step that should be learned and implemented without delay is: start rural investigation.\n\nWhy was rural investigation emphasized? Because at that time, the areas under our control were predominantly rural. Therefore, Mao Zedong strongly advocated that leading cadres devote themselves to in-depth investigations in the countryside.\n\nDriven by this rural investigation movement, many cadres began to truly immerse themselves in the countryside to investigate all aspects of rural life—its current conditions, economic activities, organizational structures, and more. One of the most well-known figures in this effort was Zhang Wentian.\n\nHe was one of the well-known members of the group who had studied in the Soviet Union. During the time in the Soviet areas, Zhang Wentian played a significant role in the implementation and even initiation of certain overly leftist policies.\n\nIt was only after the rise of the rural investigation movement that his footsteps truly began to enter the countryside and connect with reality. It was at this point that he started to integrate the Marxism-Leninism he had studied in the Soviet Union with the concrete conditions of China.\n\nThis very piece serves as the preface and epilogue written for those rural investigation reports.\n\nIn order to carry out this rural investigation, it need a very perfect template in rural investigation. So Mao Zedong had several model reports on rural investigation printed and distributed, so that everyone could learn how to carry out effective rural investigations.\n\nAt that time, the printed models provided to everyone were several reports, including the Xingguo Investigation, the Changgang Township Investigation, and the Caixi Township Investigation. These reports were investigations conducted by Mao Zedong during the period of the Central Soviet Area, the early revolutionary base established by the Chinese Communist Party. They are now available online, and readers are encouraged to take some time to read them.\n\n> The Central Soviet Area refers to the early revolutionary base established by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) during the early 1930s, particularly in regions such as Ruijin in Jiangxi Province. These areas were called “Soviet Areas” because they were modeled after the Soviet Union’s political system and served as localized governments where the CCP experimented with socialist policies, land reform, and mass mobilization. The “Central” Soviet Area was the most prominent and served as the Party’s political and military center before the Long March.\n\nNaturally, this piece serves as the preface and epilogue to those rural investigation reports.\n\n\n# Ⅱ. The preface discusses the importance of investigation in many ways, but more importantly, it emphasizes the attitude one should have toward investigation.\n\nThere are many possible methods of investigation—for example, holding inquiry meetings, conducting interviews or discussions with farmers, or directly participating in their daily lives and labor. One could also observe how production and policies are implemented in rural areas, and summarize the problems that arise during practice. All of these are valid investigative methods.\n\nHowever, methods can be copied, but attitudes cannot. Without genuine dedication to investigation, it may degenerate into a cursory observation or end up being just a superficial glance, and reduce the investigation to a mere formality. Furthermore, some individuals purport to conduct an investigation, yet upon reaching rural areas, they behave like self - proclaimed experts, condescendingly criticizing the farmers as if they were dictating rules to them.\n\nThis kind of investigation method characterized by bureaucratism is seriously unacceptable and inadvisable. Methods can be improved, However, if the attitude is not right, then the investigation will turn into something of formalism, and in the end, it will be of little avail.\n\nAfter the founding of the People's Republic of China, Mao Zedong also called on cadres to launch a widespread campaign of investigation and research. However, once many cadres actually reached the grassroots, it turned into mere formalism. Instead of genuinely studying problems in factories, rural areas, and society, most went just indulege in eating and drinking, to \"instruct\" the grassroots, to issue orders, and to put on bureaucratic airs.\n\nHere it reflects the changes and struggles in ideology.\n\nThat is to say: If you think you are more superior to the masses, and your thoughts are all advanced and scientific, and masses are alway ignorant and backward, then you don't need to conduct an investigation, becasue it will definitely be a bureaucratic and formalistic one.\n\nConversely, if you believe that genuine creativity always stems from people, and that it is among the people where practice yields true knowledge, then you can truly draw nourishment from this guide and serve them.\n\nSo in this preface, it is stated as follows.\n\n * To achive this goal, the first thing is to look down, and don't just stare at the sky all day. Without genuine interest and firm determination to delve into the details, one will never fully comprehend the essence of Chinese affairs throughout their lifetime.\n * One can never acquire comprehensive knowledge through being distracted and relying on hearsay.\n * These rural grassroots cadres, farmers, scholars, prison officials, merchants, and former grain clerks are my most respected teachers. I must be respectful, diligent, and adopt a comradely attitude when learning from them. Otherwise, they'll ignore me and hold back what they know or only share part of it.\n * Without wholehearted enthusiasm, without the determination to reach downward, without a thirst for knowledge, and without the spirit to shed pretentiousness and become as humble as a pupil—one can neither undertake nor accomplish anything well.\n * \"We must understand that the masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and ignorant. Without this understanding, we cannot acquire even the most rudimentary knowledge.\"\n\nThese words all convey one truth: genuine knowledge resides among the masses.\n\nThis reflects not only a perspective on the masses but also a scientific worldview. Why is that so?\n\nAs we recognize, human knowledge can essentially be divided into two types. The first is social science knowledge, including the disciplines we study such as culture, law, economics, philosophy, sociology, journalism, finance, and management - all these belong to social sciences, which address issues of production relations. The other type is natural science, including mathematics, physics, biology, engineering, chemistry, and thermodynamics - these belong to natural sciences, which deal with problems of productive forces.\n\nBased on these foundations, the derived disciplines such as music, fine arts, zither, chess, calligraphy and painting, etc., serve as auxiliary fields constructed upon certain production relations. They are essentially derivatives of these two fundamental disciplines, inherently incapable of breaking free from their influence and constraints.\n\nTherefore, from this perspective, we come to realize that true knowledge indeed resides among the masses. For all scholarly pursuits in this world—whether describing productive forces and production relations, resolving their contradictions, or developing and restraining productive forces—ultimately stem from the people's most fundamental productive labor.\n\nAs we often say, theory originates from practice.\n\nThrough investigating productive activities and all associated relations of production, we refine the raw materials of practice by discarding the dross and selecting the essential, eliminating the false and retaining the true, proceeding from one aspect to another and from the outside to the inner core. Such dialectical synthesis ultimately crystallizes into our theoretical framework.\n\nThrough this cyclical process, these theories are reapplied to practice, integrating with the particularities of concrete conditions, thereby driving societal development and transformation.\n\nYet within this integrative process, it is imperative to conduct concrete investigations into the specific subjects of integration, thereby discerning their particularities and enabling precise decision-making.\n\nThus, conducting practical investigations to grasp the concrete conditions and multifaceted dimensions of all things—that is, their particularities—becomes the fundamental procedure that permeates the entire process of action from beginning to end.\n\nSince all things inherently possess particularity, this procedure cannot be circumvented.\n\nThus, true knowledge resides among the masses—a perspective that is simultaneously a mass viewpoint and a scientific outlook. Without this correct mass viewpoint and scientific outlook, a genuine attitude toward the masses can never be firmly established.",normalizedContent:"# 3.1 the preface and epilogue of the rural

"米哈伊尔·伊万诺维奇，这是第三季度的经济报告。"他的助手安德烈轻声说道，将一叠文件放在桃花心木制成的宽大办公桌上。\n\n沃罗宁没有转身，只是微微点了点头。他不需要看那些数字——他知道内容会有多么糟糕。工业生产连续十二个月下滑，消费品短缺达到战后最高水平，卢布在黑市上的价值只有官方汇率的十分之一。\n\n"戈尔巴乔夫同志有什么新的指示吗？"他终于开口，声音低沉而沙哑。\n\n安德烈犹豫了一下："总书记办公室通知，明天上午十点召开政治局特别会议，讨论...讨论进一步深化改革的措施。"\n\n沃罗宁的嘴角抽动了一下，露出一个近乎苦笑的表情。"改革"，这个词已经成了莫斯科权力走廊中最时髦的词汇。但三年过去了，所谓的"改革"带来了什么？商店货架空空如也，党的纪律土崩瓦解，年轻人们沉迷于西方的摇滚乐和牛仔裤。\n\n"备车，我要去列宁格勒。"沃罗宁突然说道。\n\n"现在？但明天有政治局会议..."\n\n"就现在。"沃罗宁转过身，眼神中闪烁着安德烈从未见过的决绝，"我需要亲眼看看，我们的\'改革\'给人民带来了什么。"\n\n黑色伏尔加轿车在通往列宁格勒的公路上疾驰。沃罗宁拒绝了随行人员，只带了安德烈一人。他想看到真实的景象，而不是地方官员精心准备的表演。\n\n列宁格勒的涅瓦大街上，人群熙熙攘攘，但每个人的脸上都写满了疲惫和冷漠。沃罗宁让司机在一家国营百货商店前停车，他想亲自看看物资供应的情况。\n\n商店门口排着长长的队伍，人们裹着破旧的大衣，在寒风中瑟瑟发抖。沃罗宁戴上墨镜，竖起大衣领子，混入了人群。\n\n"排队买什么？"他问前面一位上了年纪的妇女。\n\n"听说来了黄油和香肠，"妇女头也不回地回答，声音中没有任何期待，"但轮到我们时肯定又没了。每次都这样。"\n\n商店内部比沃罗宁想象的还要糟糕。货架上空空荡荡，只有几个柜台前有人在交易。他走近一看，发现售货员正在柜台下偷偷交易——用卢布和西方货币交换稀缺商品，价格是官方定价的十倍。\n\n"同志，这是严重违法行为。"沃罗宁忍不住说道，摘下了墨镜。\n\n售货员抬头看见他的脸，顿时面色惨白。"部长同志！我...我只是..."\n\n沃罗宁没有继续听她的辩解。他转身离开商店，胸口仿佛压着一块巨石。这就是我们的社会主义？这就是我们为之奋斗七十年的成果？\n\n在返回市中心的路上，沃罗宁注意到一家新开的"合资商店"，橱窗里摆满了进口商品——法国的香水、美国的牛仔裤、日本的电子产品。门口站着几个穿着时髦的年轻人，他们嬉笑着，手里挥舞着美元。\n\n"停一下。"沃罗宁命令道。\n\n他走近那群年轻人："你们在这里做什么？"\n\n"买东西啊，老头，"一个染着金发的年轻人满不在乎地回答，"只要你有美元，这里什么都能买到。"\n\n"你们哪来的美元？"\n\n年轻人互相看了看，笑了起来："当然是做生意赚的。现在聪明人都知道，为政府工作是傻子。"\n\n沃罗宁感到一阵眩晕。七十年前，他的父亲——一个普通的钢铁工人——为了保卫新生的苏维埃政权在察里津与白军作战。而现在，他父亲用生命捍卫的理想，被这些年轻人称为"傻子"的选择。\n\n"去斯莫尔尼宫。"上车后，沃罗宁对司机说。\n\n斯莫尔尼宫，十月革命的指挥中心，列宁曾经工作过的地方。沃罗宁需要在那里寻找答案，寻找那个似乎已经被他的同志们遗忘的初心。\n\n宫内的列宁博物馆几乎空无一人。沃罗宁独自站在列宁办公室的复原场景前，凝视着那张简朴的办公桌和墙上的世界地图。\n\n"很少有人来这里了。"\n\n沃罗宁转身，看见一位白发苍苍的老人站在身后。老人穿着老式的红军制服，胸前挂满了勋章。\n\n"尼古拉·彼得罗维奇·尼古拉耶夫，"老人自我介绍道，"1917年时我是斯莫尔尼宫的警卫。"\n\n沃罗宁肃然起敬："米哈伊尔·伊万诺维奇·沃罗宁。很荣幸认识您，老同志。"\n\n他们坐在博物馆的长椅上交谈。尼古拉耶夫虽然已经九十多岁，但思维依然清晰。\n\n"我看得出你有心事，同志，"老人说，"现在的年轻领导们很少来这里了。他们忙着和资本家做朋友，忙着出卖我们曾经用鲜血换来的每寸土地。"\n\n沃罗宁感到喉咙发紧："老同志，您认为我们走错路了吗？"\n\n尼古拉耶夫的眼睛突然亮了起来："错？这是背叛！列宁同志教导我们，阶级斗争永远不会停止。而现在呢？我们的领导人正在亲手拆毁社会主义的堡垒！"\n\n老人的话像锤子一样敲击着沃罗宁的心脏。他突然明白了自己长久以来的不安从何而来——戈尔巴乔夫的"改革"不是拯救社会主义，而是在埋葬它。\n\n"我该怎么办，老同志？"沃罗宁几乎是自言自语地问道。\n\n尼古拉耶夫紧紧抓住他的手："记住你是谁，记住你宣誓效忠的是什么。工人阶级需要真正的领袖，不是那些向资本家屈膝的叛徒。"\n\n当天晚上，在列宁格勒市委安排的招待宴会上，沃罗宁心不在焉。他的脑海中不断回放着白天的所见所闻——空荡荡的货架、黑市交易、崇洋媚外的年轻人、老布尔什维克的警告。\n\n"米哈伊尔·伊万诺维奇，您对总书记的新经济政策有什么看法？"列宁格勒市委书记问道，打断了沃罗宁的思绪。\n\n沃罗宁放下酒杯，环视着宴会厅里觥筹交错的地方官员们，他们面前摆满了普通人一年都吃不到的美食和美酒。\n\n"我认为，"他一字一顿地说，"我们正在犯一个历史性的错误。"\n\n宴会厅瞬间安静下来。\n\n"我们允许私人企业侵蚀国营经济，我们纵容投机倒把破坏供应体系，我们眼睁睁看着党的纪律败坏而无动于衷。"沃罗宁的声音越来越有力，"这不是社会主义的改革，这是社会主义的背叛！"\n\n在场的地方官员们面面相觑，有人开始不安地扭动身体。\n\n"但是...但是这是中央的路线..."市委书记结结巴巴地说。\n\n"那么中央的路线就是错误的！"沃罗宁拍案而起，"我要回莫斯科，明天在政治局会议上说出真相。谁愿意和我一起捍卫真正的社会主义？"\n\n回应他的只有沉默和躲闪的目光。\n\n回到莫斯科的火车上，安德烈忧心忡忡："米哈伊尔·伊万诺维奇，您知道明天在政治局会议上说这些话意味着什么吗？"\n\n沃罗宁望着窗外飞驰而过的黑暗："意味着我终于可以无愧于我的党员良心了，安德烈。"\n\n第二天上午十点，克里姆林宫的政治局会议室里气氛凝重。戈尔巴乔夫坐在首位，面色阴沉。显然，列宁格勒的消息已经传到了他的耳中。\n\n"同志们，"戈尔巴乔夫开始讲话，"我们面临着严峻的经济形势，但这正是我们需要加快改革步伐的理由..."\n\n"不，米哈伊尔·谢尔盖耶维奇。"沃罗宁打断了他，这在政治局会议上几乎是前所未有的，"问题不在于改革的速度，而在于改革的方向。"\n\n会议室内一片哗然。\n\n"请继续说，米哈伊尔·伊万诺维奇。"戈尔巴乔夫冷冷地说。\n\n沃罗宁站起身，从公文包中取出一叠照片，分发给在座的委员们。照片上是列宁格勒商店空荡荡的货架、黑市交易、排队等候的普通群众。\n\n"这就是我们\'改革\'的成果，"沃罗宁的声音在颤抖，但不是因为恐惧，而是因为愤怒，"我们正在摧毁七十年来工人阶级取得的一切成就！"\n\n他详细讲述了在列宁格勒的所见所闻，以及他与老布尔什维克尼古拉耶夫的谈话。\n\n"同志们，我们偏离了列宁主义的道路。所谓的\'市场社会主义\'不过是资本主义复辟的遮羞布！我提议立即停止私有化进程，恢复中央计划经济的核心地位，严厉打击投机倒把和腐败行为。"\n\n会议室内鸦雀无声。戈尔巴乔夫的脸涨得通红。\n\n"沃罗宁同志，"他一字一顿地说，"你的观点不仅错误，而且危险。这是对党中央决策的公开挑战！"\n\n"那么我宁愿做一个坚持真理的\'危险分子\'，也不做背叛工人阶级的\'改革家\'！"沃罗宁反击道。\n\n激烈的辩论持续了数小时。令沃罗宁惊讶的是，虽然大多数政治局委员保持沉默，但也有几个人——主要是老一辈的领导人——暗中对他表示支持。\n\n会议结束时，戈尔巴乔夫做出了妥协：成立一个特别委员会"研究"沃罗宁的提议，但改革进程不会停止。这明显是一个拖延战术。\n\n回到办公室后，安德烈匆忙跟进来："克格勃的科尔扎科夫将军要求立即见您。"\n\n沃罗宁冷笑一声："这么快就来抓我了？让他进来。"\n\n科尔扎科夫——克格勃的实权人物——大步走进办公室，身后跟着两名穿便衣的警卫。\n\n"米哈伊尔·伊万诺维奇，"科尔扎科夫面无表情地说，"出于安全考虑，建议您取消下周前往乌拉尔工业区的行程。"\n\n"这是命令还是建议，将军同志？"\n\n"随您怎么理解。"科尔扎科夫的目光冰冷，"现在的局势...很微妙。"\n\n沃罗宁站起身，与科尔扎科夫对视："告诉派你来的人，我哪儿都会去。如果工人阶级需要听到真相，那么我就会去告诉他们真相。现在，请离开我的办公室。"\n\n科尔扎科夫离开后，安德烈几乎要崩溃了："他们会逮捕您的！或者更糟..."\n\n"不，安德烈，他们不敢，"沃罗宁平静地说，"至少现在不敢。因为他们在害怕。"\n\n"害怕什么？"\n\n沃罗宁望向窗外克里姆林宫的红星："害怕人民觉醒，害怕真正的社会主义力量重新集结。"\n\n当晚，沃罗宁秘密会见了几个支持他的军方领导人和党内元老。他们决定采取一个大胆的行动——绕过官方媒体，直接向基层党员和工人群众发出呼吁。\n\n"我们有地下印刷厂，可以印制传单，"一位老将军说，"还有几个忠于社会主义的电台工作人员。"\n\n"不，还不够，"沃罗宁思考着，"我们需要一个象征，一个能让普通工人立即理解并支持我们的口号。"\n\n他想起尼古拉耶夫老人的话，眼睛突然亮了起来："\'回到列宁的道路\'——这就是我们的口号。"\n\n三天后，莫斯科、列宁格勒、基辅等主要城市的工厂区突然出现了大量传单，上面印着沃罗宁在列宁格勒拍摄的照片和他撰写的《告全体劳动人民书》。几个地下电台也开始播放沃罗宁的录音讲话。\n\n效果立竿见影。乌拉尔机械厂的工人们率先罢工，要求恢复社会主义原则。接着是顿巴斯矿区的矿工。他们打出的标语简单而有力："我们要社会主义，不要投机倒把！"\n\n克格勃迅速行动，查封印刷厂，逮捕电台工作人员。但信息已经传播出去，一场自发的社会主义复兴运动正在形成。\n\n政治局再次召开紧急会议。这一次，戈尔巴乔夫明显慌了神。\n\n"沃罗宁同志，你必须立即公开收回你的言论！"他咆哮道，"你正在煽动社会动荡！"\n\n"不，米哈伊尔·谢尔盖耶维奇，"沃罗宁冷静地回答，"动荡的根源是你的政策背叛了工人阶级。我只是给了人民表达真实意愿的机会。"\n\n会议不欢而散。沃罗宁知道，时间不多了。克格勃随时可能逮捕他。但在那之前，他还有最后一件事要做。\n\n"安德烈，准备车，"他对忠心的助手说，"我们今晚就去乌拉尔。"\n\n"但是克格勃..."\n\n"正因如此，我们必须现在就走。"\n\n深夜，一辆不起眼的伏尔加轿车悄悄驶出莫斯科，向东方的乌拉尔山脉疾驰而去。在那里，苏联最大的工业中心和数百万工人阶级正等待着听到一个不同的声音，一个关于社会主义复兴的声音。\n\n沃罗宁望着前方黑暗中的道路，想起了列宁在十月革命前夜说过的话："有时候，几十年里什么也没发生；有时候，几周里就发生了几十年的事。"\n\n历史的风暴正在聚集，而他已经做好了迎接它的准备。',normalizedContent:'1989年的莫斯科，寒冬比往年来得更早。十月的天空已经飘起了雪花，覆盖在克里姆林宫的金顶上，给这座象征着苏维埃权力的建筑群披上了一层苍白的裹尸布。\n\n米哈伊尔·伊万诺维奇·沃罗宁站在部长会议办公室的窗前，凝视着窗外的景象。他五十六岁，灰白的头发修剪得一丝不苟，深陷的眼窝中是一双锐利如鹰的蓝眼睛。作为苏联部长会议副主席，他是这个庞大国家经济事务的实际掌舵者之一。 "米哈伊尔·伊万诺维奇，这是第三季度的经济报告。"他的助手安德烈轻声说道，将一叠文件放在桃花心木制成的宽大办公桌上。\n\n沃罗宁没有转身，只是微微点了点头。他不需要看那些数字——他知道内容会有多么糟糕。工业生产连续十二个月下滑，消费品短缺达到战后最高水平，卢布在黑市上的价值只有官方汇率的十分之一。\n\n"戈尔巴乔夫同志有什么新的指示吗？"他终于开口，声音低沉而沙哑。\n\n安德烈犹豫了一下："总书记办公室通知，明天上午十点召开政治局特别会议，讨论...讨论进一步深化改革的措施。"\n\n沃罗宁的嘴角抽动了一下，露出一个近乎苦笑的表情。"改革"，这个词已经成了莫斯科权力走廊中最时髦的词汇。但三年过去了，所谓的"改革"带来了什么？商店货架空空如也，党的纪律土崩瓦解，年轻人们沉迷于西方的摇滚乐和牛仔裤。\n\n"备车，我要去列宁格勒。"沃罗宁突然说道。\n\n"现在？但明天有政治局会议..."\n\n"就现在。"沃罗宁转过身，眼神中闪烁着安德烈从未见过的决绝，"我需要亲眼看看，我们的\'改革\'给人民带来了什么。"\n\n黑色伏尔加轿车在通往列宁格勒的公路上疾驰。沃罗宁拒绝了随行人员，只带了安德烈一人。他想看到真实的景象，而不是地方官员精心准备的表演。\n\n列宁格勒的涅瓦大街上，人群熙熙攘攘，但每个人的脸上都写满了疲惫和冷漠。沃罗宁让司机在一家国营百货商店前停车，他想亲自看看物资供应的情况。\n\n商店门口排着长长的队伍，人们裹着破旧的大衣，在寒风中瑟瑟发抖。沃罗宁戴上墨镜，竖起大衣领子，混入了人群。\n\n"排队买什么？"他问前面一位上了年纪的妇女。\n\n"听说来了黄油和香肠，"妇女头也不回地回答，声音中没有任何期待，"但轮到我们时肯定又没了。每次都这样。"\n\n商店内部比沃罗宁想象的还要糟糕。货架上空空荡荡，只有几个柜台前有人在交易。他走近一看，发现售货员正在柜台下偷偷交易——用卢布和西方货币交换稀缺商品，价格是官方定价的十倍。\n\n"同志，这是严重违法行为。"沃罗宁忍不住说道，摘下了墨镜。\n\n售货员抬头看见他的脸，顿时面色惨白。"部长同志！我...我只是..."\n\n沃罗宁没有继续听她的辩解。他转身离开商店，胸口仿佛压着一块巨石。这就是我们的社会主义？这就是我们为之奋斗七十年的成果？\n\n在返回市中心的路上，沃罗宁注意到一家新开的"合资商店"，橱窗里摆满了进口商品——法国的香水、美国的牛仔裤、日本的电子产品。门口站着几个穿着时髦的年轻人，他们嬉笑着，手里挥舞着美元。\n\n"停一下。"沃罗宁命令道。\n\n他走近那群年轻人："你们在这里做什么？"\n\n"买东西啊，老头，"一个染着金发的年轻人满不在乎地回答，"只要你有美元，这里什么都能买到。"\n\n"你们哪来的美元？"\n\n年轻人互相看了看，笑了起来："当然是做生意赚的。现在聪明人都知道，为政府工作是傻子。"\n\n沃罗宁感到一阵眩晕。七十年前，他的父亲——一个普通的钢铁工人——为了保卫新生的苏维埃政权在察里津与白军作战。而现在，他父亲用生命捍卫的理想，被这些年轻人称为"傻子"的选择。\n\n"去斯莫尔尼宫。"上车后，沃罗宁对司机说。\n\n斯莫尔尼宫，十月革命的指挥中心，列宁曾经工作过的地方。沃罗宁需要在那里寻找答案，寻找那个似乎已经被他的同志们遗忘的初心。\n\n宫内的列宁博物馆几乎空无一人。沃罗宁独自站在列宁办公室的复原场景前，凝视着那张简朴的办公桌和墙上的世界地图。\n\n"很少有人来这里了。"\n\n沃罗宁转身，看见一位白发苍苍的老人站在身后。老人穿着老式的红军制服，胸前挂满了勋章。\n\n"尼古拉·彼得罗维奇·尼古拉耶夫，"老人自我介绍道，"1917年时我是斯莫尔尼宫的警卫。"\n\n沃罗宁肃然起敬："米哈伊尔·伊万诺维奇·沃罗宁。很荣幸认识您，老同志。"\n\n他们坐在博物馆的长椅上交谈。尼古拉耶夫虽然已经九十多岁，但思维依然清晰。\n\n"我看得出你有心事，同志，"老人说，"现在的年轻领导们很少来这里了。他们忙着和资本家做朋友，忙着出卖我们曾经用鲜血换来的每寸土地。"\n\n沃罗宁感到喉咙发紧："老同志，您认为我们走错路了吗？"\n\n尼古拉耶夫的眼睛突然亮了起来："错？这是背叛！列宁同志教导我们，阶级斗争永远不会停止。而现在呢？我们的领导人正在亲手拆毁社会主义的堡垒！"\n\n老人的话像锤子一样敲击着沃罗宁的心脏。他突然明白了自己长久以来的不安从何而来——戈尔巴乔夫的"改革"不是拯救社会主义，而是在埋葬它。\n\n"我该怎么办，老同志？"沃罗宁几乎是自言自语地问道。\n\n尼古拉耶夫紧紧抓住他的手："记住你是谁，记住你宣誓效忠的是什么。工人阶级需要真正的领袖，不是那些向资本家屈膝的叛徒。"\n\n当天晚上，在列宁格勒市委安排的招待宴会上，沃罗宁心不在焉。他的脑海中不断回放着白天的所见所闻——空荡荡的货架、黑市交易、崇洋媚外的年轻人、老布尔什维克的警告。\n\n"米哈伊尔·伊万诺维奇，您对总书记的新经济政策有什么看法？"列宁格勒市委书记问道，打断了沃罗宁的思绪。\n\n沃罗宁放下酒杯，环视着宴会厅里觥筹交错的地方官员们，他们面前摆满了普通人一年都吃不到的美食和美酒。\n\n"我认为，"他一字一顿地说，"我们正在犯一个历史性的错误。"\n\n宴会厅瞬间安静下来。\n\n"我们允许私人企业侵蚀国营经济，我们纵容投机倒把破坏供应体系，我们眼睁睁看着党的纪律败坏而无动于衷。"沃罗宁的声音越来越有力，"这不是社会主义的改革，这是社会主义的背叛！"\n\n在场的地方官员们面面相觑，有人开始不安地扭动身体。\n\n"但是...但是这是中央的路线..."市委书记结结巴巴地说。\n\n"那么中央的路线就是错误的！"沃罗宁拍案而起，"我要回莫斯科，明天在政治局会议上说出真相。谁愿意和我一起捍卫真正的社会主义？"\n\n回应他的只有沉默和躲闪的目光。\n\n回到莫斯科的火车上，安德烈忧心忡忡："米哈伊尔·伊万诺维奇，您知道明天在政治局会议上说这些话意味着什么吗？"\n\n沃罗宁望着窗外飞驰而过的黑暗："意味着我终于可以无愧于我的党员良心了，安德烈。"\n\n第二天上午十点，克里姆林宫的政治局会议室里气氛凝重。戈尔巴乔夫坐在首位，面色阴沉。显然，列宁格勒的消息已经传到了他的耳中。\n\n"同志们，"戈尔巴乔夫开始讲话，"我们面临着严峻的经济形势，但这正是我们需要加快改革步伐的理由..."\n\n"不，米哈伊尔·谢尔盖耶维奇。"沃罗宁打断了他，这在政治局会议上几乎是前所未有的，"问题不在于改革的速度，而在于改革的方向。"\n\n会议室内一片哗然。\n\n"请继续说，米哈伊尔·伊万诺维奇。"戈尔巴乔夫冷冷地说。\n\n沃罗宁站起身，从公文包中取出一叠照片，分发给在座的委员们。照片上是列宁格勒商店空荡荡的货架、黑市交易、排队等候的普通群众。\n\n"这就是我们\'改革\'的成果，"沃罗宁的声音在颤抖，但不是因为恐惧，而是因为愤怒，"我们正在摧毁七十年来工人阶级取得的一切成就！"\n\n他详细讲述了在列宁格勒的所见所闻，以及他与老布尔什维克尼古拉耶夫的谈话。\n\n"同志们，我们偏离了列宁主义的道路。所谓的\'市场社会主义\'不过是资本主义复辟的遮羞布！我提议立即停止私有化进程，恢复中央计划经济的核心地位，严厉打击投机倒把和腐败行为。"\n\n会议室内鸦雀无声。戈尔巴乔夫的脸涨得通红。\n\n"沃罗宁同志，"他一字一顿地说，"你的观点不仅错误，而且危险。这是对党中央决策的公开挑战！"\n\n"那么我宁愿做一个坚持真理的\'危险分子\'，也不做背叛工人阶级的\'改革家\'！"沃罗宁反击道。\n\n激烈的辩论持续了数小时。令沃罗宁惊讶的是，虽然大多数政治局委员保持沉默，但也有几个人——主要是老一辈的领导人——暗中对他表示支持。\n\n会议结束时，戈尔巴乔夫做出了妥协：成立一个特别委员会"研究"沃罗宁的提议，但改革进程不会停止。这明显是一个拖延战术。\n\n回到办公室后，安德烈匆忙跟进来："克格勃的科尔扎科夫将军要求立即见您。"\n\n沃罗宁冷笑一声："这么快就来抓我了？让他进来。"\n\n科尔扎科夫——克格勃的实权人物——大步走进办公室，身后跟着两名穿便衣的警卫。\n\n"米哈伊尔·伊万诺维奇，"科尔扎科夫面无表情地说，"出于安全考虑，建议您取消下周前往乌拉尔工业区的行程。"\n\n"这是命令还是建议，将军同志？"\n\n"随您怎么理解。"科尔扎科夫的目光冰冷，"现在的局势...很微妙。"\n\n沃罗宁站起身，与科尔扎科夫对视："告诉派你来的人，我哪儿都会去。如果工人阶级需要听到真相，那么我就会去告诉他们真相。现在，请离开我的办公室。"\n\n科尔扎科夫离开后，安德烈几乎要崩溃了："他们会逮捕您的！或者更糟..."\n\n"不，安德烈，他们不敢，"沃罗宁平静地说，"至少现在不敢。因为他们在害怕。"\n\n"害怕什么？"\n\n沃罗宁望向窗外克里姆林宫的红星："害怕人民觉醒，害怕真正的社会主义力量重新集结。"\n\n当晚，沃罗宁秘密会见了几个支持他的军方领导人和党内元老。他们决定采取一个大胆的行动——绕过官方媒体，直接向基层党员和工人群众发出呼吁。\n\n"我们有地下印刷厂，可以印制传单，"一位老将军说，"还有几个忠于社会主义的电台工作人员。"\n\n"不，还不够，"沃罗宁思考着，"我们需要一个象征，一个能让普通工人立即理解并支持我们的口号。"\n\n他想起尼古拉耶夫老人的话，眼睛突然亮了起来："\'回到列宁的道路\'——这就是我们的口号。"\n\n三天后，莫斯科、列宁格勒、基辅等主要城市的工厂区突然出现了大量传单，上面印着沃罗宁在列宁格勒拍摄的照片和他撰写的《告全体劳动人民书》。几个地下电台也开始播放沃罗宁的录音讲话。\n\n效果立竿见影。乌拉尔机械厂的工人们率先罢工，要求恢复社会主义原则。接着是顿巴斯矿区的矿工。他们打出的标语简单而有力："我们要社会主义，不要投机倒把！"\n\n克格勃迅速行动，查封印刷厂，逮捕电台工作人员。但信息已经传播出去，一场自发的社会主义复兴运动正在形成。\n\n政治局再次召开紧急会议。这一次，戈尔巴乔夫明显慌了神。\n\n"沃罗宁同志，你必须立即公开收回你的言论！"他咆哮道，"你正在煽动社会动荡！"\n\n"不，米哈伊尔·谢尔盖耶维奇，"沃罗宁冷静地回答，"动荡的根源是你的政策背叛了工人阶级。我只是给了人民表达真实意愿的机会。"\n\n会议不欢而散。沃罗宁知道，时间不多了。克格勃随时可能逮捕他。但在那之前，他还有最后一件事要做。\n\n"安德烈，准备车，"他对忠心的助手说，"我们今晚就去乌拉尔。"\n\n"但是克格勃..."\n\n"正因如此，我们必须现在就走。"\n\n深夜，一辆不起眼的伏尔加轿车悄悄驶出莫斯科，向东方的乌拉尔山脉疾驰而去。在那里，苏联最大的工业中心和数百万工人阶级正等待着听到一个不同的声音，一个关于社会主义复兴的声音。\n\n沃罗宁望着前方黑暗中的道路，想起了列宁在十月革命前夜说过的话："有时候，几十年里什么也没发生；有时候，几周里就发生了几十年的事。"\n\n历史的风暴正在聚集，而他已经做好了迎接它的准备。',charsets:{cjk:!0}},{title:"第二章：来自东方的小红书",frontmatter:{title:"第二章：来自东方的小红书",date:"2025-07-16T14:57:09.000Z",permalink:"/pages/924c4a/",categories:null,tags:[null],author:{name:"TommyZeng",link:"https://tommyzeng777.github.io/TommyPEN/pages/1b697e/"},readingShow:"top"},regularPath:"/11.%E5%B8%83%E5%B0%94%E4%BB%80%E7%BB%B4%E5%85%8B%E7%9A%84%E5%86%8D%E6%AC
